<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>
</div>


<p>In this volume I have collected a few of my old
papers which all contained something <i>new</i> at
the date at which they appeared. They are all more
or less connected with Shakespeare, and bear at
least on my studies to try to understand the influences
which affected his immediate predecessors
and teachers, those which helped to mould his own
thought and character, and those which showed
something of his influence on his contemporaries
and immediate successors. My period therefore extended
from the accession of Henry VIII in 1509, to
the national crisis in 1640. Little as each item of
itself may seem to tell, every one helps to fill in, as
with a touch of the brush, the colours in the background,
which throw out more clearly the outlines
of the central figure. For Shakespeare knew all
about the training of the boys at school, all about
the legal troubles of his relatives and friends and
partners, he knew the contemporary history and
literature of his time, and above all, its <i>character</i>.
If perhaps I have made too prominent the story of
his monument in Stratford, of which he could not
know, it was to draw attention to the contemporary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
estimate of himself and his genius as recorded on
that tomb; and to collect every scrap I could find
to throw light on its subsequent history, the last
touch of which was provided me by the kindness of
Mr. Dugdale of Merivale.</p>

<p>I included the Introductory Chapter, which had
never been printed, in remembrance of a special occasion,
fully to be understood only by the members
of the Shakespeare Societies. On a day of storm,
snow, and sleet, in Stratford-on-Avon, the 23rd of
April 1908, I had thought it my duty to travel
to London to be present at the Commemoration
Dinner at which Dr. F. J. Furnivall was to preside,
and the guests of honour were to be Mr. Austin,
then Poet Laureate, and Sir John Hare. They were
each to deliver an address. When I was comfortably
seated at dinner, Dr. Furnivall sent Mr. Hunt,
then Hon. Secretary, to say that Sir John Hare
had brought a written address which he now thought
unsuitable to deliver on the occasion, and our
President asked me to oblige him by filling the gap,
as well as I could. Mr. Austin read an interesting
paper on “What we can learn of Shakespeare from
his plays.” I could only speak from my own
heart, which was very full of Shakespeare that day.
Mr. Austin came up to me afterwards and said: “If
it is anything to you to know it, I would like to tell
you that I agreed with every word you said.” Our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</span>
dear old President was pleased that the possible
hitch had been averted, and as my remarks had
been taken down, he wished them preserved. So,
though there is nothing new in it, I thought I might
at the same time preserve a memory of that special
day, and secure a good general introduction to the
results of my work.</p>

<p>I thought that it was wiser to print these papers
<i>as they first appeared</i>, with very trifling occasional
alterations in construction, for the sake of clearness.
What I have learned since on the subjects, I have
put in the postscripts.</p>

<p>I had not calculated sufficiently for the expansion
of magazine type when it takes book form, and I
have had to withdraw a good many papers which I
had hoped might have appeared. Therefore the
links of connection between some of the later papers
have occasionally had to be broken, and I have had
to postpone republishing my special literary and
critical Shakespearean articles, and to choose a title
which fairly covers the bulk of those now produced.</p>

<p>My articles were formerly printed in circumstances
which prevented my giving due thanks to
many helpful friends. I cannot even now give expression
to all the gratitude I felt and feel to many,
but I must acknowledge some of it. A large share
is due for their helpful kindness, especially to the
officials of the Public Record Office, of the British<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
Museum, of the Bodleian Library; to Dr. Reginald
Sharpe, Keeper of the Guildhall Records; to Mr.
Richard Savage and Mr. Wellstood, curators of
the Records at Stratford-on-Avon; to the late
Mr. Kingdon, formerly master of the Grocers’ Company;
to the Haberdashers’ Company; to Dr. Kitto
and his son for giving me access to the general
papers of St. Martin-in-the-Fields; to the Clergy
and Churchwardens of St. Margaret’s, Westminster;
and to Mr. Smith who did so much for research
students there. I must also thank many clergymen
for allowing me to see their registers, and Capt.
C. W. Cottrell Dormer for admission to his private
manuscripts. I owe much gratitude to Mr. Joseph
Gray for photographing and enlarging Dugdale’s
engraving of Shakespeare’s tomb, and latest, not
least, I must acknowledge the kindness of Mr.
W. F. S. Dugdale of Merivale, in allowing me to
see the sketch-book of his illustrious ancestor, which
contains the drawings which he made from Warwickshire
Tombs.</p>

<p>I have to thank, in another respect, for having
given me permission to republish the articles previously
inserted in their journals, the Editors of the
“Fortnightly Review,” the “Field,” the “Yorkshire
Post,” the “Stratford-upon-Avon Herald,” the
“Pall Mall Gazette,” and the Editors of the German
“Jahr Buch” and “Archiv.” I have also to thank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span>
Mr. Murray the proprietor of the “Monthly Review,”
Mr. Sinnet the proprietor of “Broad Views,”
and especially Mr. J. E. Francis the proprietor of
the “Athenæum,” from which review the greatest
number of my papers have been borrowed. I have
further to thank the Secretary of the Royal Society
of Literature, for permission to reprint two of my
Lectures from their Proceedings. And I thank
cordially all those kind friends who encouraged me
to work, and to write, and to publish, though that
was long before any of us knew what terrors this
fair month would bring. In Shakespeare’s environment,
there was also the <i>crisis</i> of his century, and
from his own experience he could write the brave
words that give us hope, “If England to herself will
but be true.”</p>

<p>It is so much the fashion to write and speak of Shakespeare’s
misfortunes, his disabilities, disadvantages, and
lack of preparedness for becoming great, that perhaps I
may best fit my opportunity by touching upon what I
believe to be his <i>good fortunes</i>. It is all very true to say,
that “poets are born, not made,” but there is a converse
possibility, too finely expressed in Gray’s elegy to need
repeating. Shakespeare might have been born a poet, and
he might have been drowned in the Avon, as his contemporary
of the same name was drowned in 1575; or he
might have been carried by compelling currents of his life,
away from the fruition of the high possibilities of his genius,
instead of directly towards them. The whole truth is, that
great poets are <i>both born and made</i>, and it is worth pausing
to dwell on some of the steps in the making of this
“Maker.” In no life is it more clear than in his that</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Shakespeare was <i>fortunate</i> in the place of his birth.
Warwickshire was in the very heart of England. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
whole shire was haunted by legends and stories of a
romantic past from the time when it was the Mercia of the
Saxons down to the desolating Wars of the Roses. His
birthplace was but seven miles from the castled city of
Warwick, glorified by traditions of Cymbeline, Guiderius,
Ethelfleda, Phillis, and Guy, one of the seven champions
of Christendom. Stratford was not far from the tragic Vale
of Evesham, from the holiday making of the Cotswolds,
and it lay amid gently swelling hills and dales, the richly
cultivated Feldon to east and south, the stretches of woodland
to north and west, sufficient to satisfy an artist, a
dreamer, or a poet. It was of much more relative importance
in the sixteenth century than it is to-day. It stood at
the crossing of the two great thoroughfares of the whole
country, its Avon was another highway, for water transit
was much more used in olden days than now. The river
was spanned at Stratford by a noble bridge, safe even in
floods (thanks to Sir Hugh Clopton); it had important
markets, a prosperous trade in wool, manufactures of cloth
and leather and other things, and was rich in agricultural
commodities. It was a spirited and independent little
town, and many important families lived in its neighbourhood.
The house in Henley Street in which the poet was
born (three houses combined), made a roomy and comfortable
home for his youth.</p>

<p>He was fortunate in the date of his birth, on or about
23rd April, 1564. I say on or about, as it might have been a
day or two earlier or later. He was baptized on the 26th,
and it was then usual enough to baptize infants on the
third day after birth. Tradition has always given us the
23rd as the birthday, St. George’s day. In those days,
before the reformation of the Calendar, the 23rd of April fell
later in the season than it does to-day. There were twelve
more days of sunshine to open the May blossoms, and to
encourage the nightingales to sing in welcome of another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
sweet singer. The poet always loved the spring; he was a
May-blossom himself.</p>

<p>He was <i>fortunate</i> also in the period in which he arrived.
England’s heart was heaving. Great spiritual movements
had stirred men’s souls to their depths, and given them
inspiration to think for themselves amid diverse creeds; the
literary renaissance had brought their intellects in touch
with the great minds of other times, and diverse countries;
learning had become a <i>hunger</i> as well as a fashion; students
translated, imitated, emulated the philosophers and poets
of Greece, Italy, and France. England was in the high tide
of fervour through its emancipation from the Pope’s
authority, its new sense of independence, its command of
the sea, and its ever-widening geographical horizons; the
romance of a maiden Queen, fortunate since her accession,
made a new development in the spirit of patriotism. Poets
born in the previous reigns shed their glories on Elizabeth’s.
The very atmosphere was charged with negative poetical
electricity, which only waited for a positive stimulus to
flash forth in light.</p>

<p>He was <i>fortunate</i> in his parents. We know only too little
of them, but we do know something. John Shakespeare
had sprung from an honest yeoman family, which evidently
had seen better days. It had contributed a Prioress and a
Sub-Prioress to the venerated Priory of Wroxall, and it had
its family legends concerning royal service and royal
grants, not necessarily unfounded, but frustrated somehow,
perhaps by an Empson or a Dudley. There is a possibility
that he had had a Welsh mother, and inherited blue blood
from a Cymric past. He evidently had some special charm
in person, manner, or wit, because all his life he seems to
have been popular among his fellows, and he managed to
win the heart and the hand of the youngest daughter of a
“gentleman of worship” in the neighbourhood, who was
the ground landlord of his father’s farm in Snitterfield. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
only definite notice we have of him is “that he was a merry-cheeked
old man who said ‘Will was a good honest fellow;
but he darest have crakt a jesst with him at any time’”
(Dr. Andrew Clark, from the Plume MS. at Maldon). John
had risen through all the grades of honour in the town, had
shown his predilection for the drama by his payments to
players, a predilection not shared by the majority of his
townsmen, and we may take it he could tell a story and be
good company. The mothers of men are more important to
their youth than their fathers are. Mary Arden had descended
from the Ardens of Park Hall, a storied Saxon line, counting
amidst its ancestors no less a hero than King Alfred. She
evidently had the Saxon virtues, was prudent and capable,
or her father would not have left her executrix at his death.
She is said to have been beautiful; we may believe it, if we
realize the verbal descriptions, not the painted portraits of
her son. A strong woman, whom we see reflected in the
poet’s noble women’s characters, and yet romantic enough
to marry where she loved, though doubtless many men of
better position and of greater wealth in the country, would
have been glad enough of such a well-dowered <i>gentle</i> bride.
Hers was evidently a happy marriage, and she ensured her
son the benefits of a happy home.</p>

<p>He was <i>fortunate</i> in his school. Stratford had once had
a College of Priests with its Collegiate Church, an honourable
Guild of the Holy Cross, and a notable grammar
school; but all had vanished before the exterminating
Henry. John Shakespeare and many of his contemporaries
had suffered through the suppression, and had grown up
weak in English, lacking in Latin, and unable to write, for
their sovereign’s sins. But the school had been restored by
King Edward VI, and was in good working order by the
time John’s eldest son was ready for it. The post of the
master of the Stratford Grammar School was one of the
plums of the profession, as he had twice the salary of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
Master of Eton. We are sure from the Chamberlain’s accounts,
that the best men to be had, graduates in a university,
were selected by the town councillors. The grammar
school was free to all the sons of burgesses, so that no
consideration of expense could have kept back William
Shakespeare from its advantages, even at the time of his
father’s difficulties. He would meet there not only the boys
of the town about his own age, but the sons of the neighbouring
gentry. We know from several sources the books
then in use for each form of a grammar school, and we may
reckon what training would be offered young Shakespeare
in classic literature to form his English style. A little
better than the average, we should presume it to have
been. Becon, some years before, had proclaimed Warwickshire
to be the most intellectual of the English Counties,
and there is some witness to show it still could hold its
own.</p>

<p>He was <i>fortunate</i> in his seeming misfortunes. It was all
very well to be born in the little town, with its sweet country
surroundings, but Shakespeare would never have been
the world-poet had he spent his life in Stratford. The
place was not big enough for his expansion. But the cloth
manufacturers of Stratford suffered heavily from the importation
of foreign manufactured goods, and the great
farmers and engrossers did what they could to kill its trade
in wool. John Shakespeare lost heavily, he sold Snitterfield,
probably meant as the portion of his younger children,
he mortgaged and lost Asbies, destined by him as the inheritance
and future living of his eldest son. And young
Shakespeare was thus saved from being a little country
farmer, and <i>forced</i> to go to seek his fortunes in London,
where he developed into what was in him to be. In London
was literary culture from books and men. In London also
he was faced with difficulties. He had hoped for so many
things; nothing happened to him which he expected or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
desired; no door was opened to him except that of the
stage. Though he pitifully cries:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">O, for my sake do you with fortune chide,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That doth not better for my life provide</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than public means, which public manners breed;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">yet that led him to the very line of life in which he was
best fitted to excel, through which he became what he was.</p>

<p>He was <i>fortunate</i> even in his marriage. I know that an
opposite view is generally accepted, but I do not believe it.
The only reason suggested is that Anne Hathaway was
seven years older than himself. Did any one ever meet a
bold, masterful, well-grown lad of eighteen whose first love
was not a woman older than himself? Many happy marriages
have been made with this difference of age, and I do
not think Shakespeare’s an exception. I believe she was a
timid, delicate, fair-haired girl, type of the submissive
wives he paints. There is reason to believe that he took
his family with him to London as soon as he found a home.
When fortune came he bought them the best house in
Stratford, and came to dwell beside them, as soon as he
could give up the acting part of his work. There he died
among them, away from the world of business, envy, and of
strife. There is nothing to warrant the blot on his good
name and that of his wife so much insisted on by those
who have not studied the question. Mr. J. S. Gray, in
“Shakespeare’s Marriage,” is the only writer who has put
it straight, and he speaks with authority.</p>

<p>There is nothing derogatory in the legacy of the second-best
bed; it was evidently her own last request. She was
sure of her widow’s <i>third</i>; she was sure of her daughters’
love and care, but she wanted the bed she had been accustomed
to, before the grandeur at New Place came to her.</p>

<p>He was <i>fortunate</i> in the family she brought him, though
unfortunately, his only son was a twin, apparently delicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
like his mother, and he died young. For his sake Shakespeare
called all boys <i>sweet</i>. His daughters lived a longer
life, the elder is recorded as “witty above her sex,” because
she was like her father, a devoted daughter, a loving wife,
a public benefactor. She brought him for his son-in-law
the physician Dr. John Hall, great not only in his own
county, who first used anti-scorbutics. He must have been
a congenial companion to his father-in-law. Then the little
granddaughter came, who must have been his joy.</p>

<p>He was <i>fortunate</i> in his friends. London was then but
a little city, after all; it could easily be crossed and compassed
on foot; its inhabitants did not reach the sum total
of 300,000. On arrival he would <i>study</i> London and Westminster,
twin-cities, so great and so story-laden, the
clear shining Thames, its haunted Bridge, its Tower, its
Churches, and the Northern and Southern heights, where he
could revel in Nature, as he did at home. He may have
gone to London with high hopes, and many introductions.
We do not know of those who mocked him, of those who
gave him no direct help. We do not know what he aimed
at, but we know he failed. Perhaps he hoped to be made a
Yeoman of the Privy Chamber, like Roger Shakespeare
and Robert Arden, a Royal Messenger like Thomas Shakespeare,
a Royal Letter Carrier, like Edmund Spenser. Possibly
he meant to volunteer his help against the Spaniard,
but they did without him. Possibly his ambitions sank to
a share in the grocery business of Sadler and Quiney at
Bucklersbury. Long waiting at the doors of negligent
patrons seems to have been his share. But through all he
had <i>one friend</i> at least, during his period of toil and preparation.
We know that he knew his townsman, Richard
Field (his senior by three years), who had been at Stratford
Grammar School, and entered life on the solid lines of an
apprentice to Thomas Vautrollier, the great French printer,
and became his son-in-law and successor. Doubtless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
Shakespeare went at first to reside with him; certainly he
was much with him. His shop was the poet’s university,
where he read for his degree, by the inclusions and exclusions
of the bookshelves. The firm was licensed to keep
foreign journeymen printers, and had many monopolies of
classical works. From these alone did Shakespeare quote,
and Field’s publications account for the most of his learning.
There he was inspired by “Plutarch’s Lives Englished
by North,” trained by “Puttenham’s Art of English
Poesie,” in the canons of literature and a taste for blank
verse. There he found books on music, philosophy, science,
travels, medicine, language, and literature, which we <i>know</i>
he read. It was Richard Field who printed and published
Shakespeare’s two poems, the only works which we are sure
he published and corrected himself. By this publication,
the friend of his everyday life became associated with the
friend of his higher dreams, who patronized, criticised, inspired,
glorified Shakespeare, and helped to shape his
genius. It is something to hear from his contemporary
Webster, the praise of Shakespeare’s “right happy and
copious <i>industry</i>.” For he must have been hard at work, in
his early days in the metropolis to have been able to publish
a poem by 1593, which put him at once among the
highest group of contemporary poets over which Spenser
reigned supreme. That took the sting out of the dying
Greene’s scorn the year before concerning the upstart playwright
who “thought he could bumbast out a blank verse
as well as the best of us.” The young Earl of Southampton
had supplied the one thing hitherto wanting in the culture
of the Stratford stranger. He was the ideal man of rank,
young, learned, refined, untrammelled, wealthy, impulsive,
susceptible to genius, critical in judgement. Next year, ere
he came of age, Shakespeare had written for him the “Rape
of Lucrece,” and dedicated it to him as the “Lord of his
Love.” Through the same time he was writing the sonnets,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
the witnesses of the thoughts, hopes, feelings, fears, joys,
he had passed through with his special friend.</p>

<p>He was <i>fortunate</i>, too, in his “fellows.” He had found
no doors open to him but those of James Burbage and his
theatre. Play-acting was repugnant alike to his taste and
his pride: we can learn that from the Sonnets.</p>

<p>But having been received into the company, having been
trained in the “<i>quality</i>,” he did his best to conquer. He
was singularly fitted for the stage, as John Davies says,
“Wit, courage, good shape, good parts, and all good.”
From a performer he went on to be a writer of plays.
His company always stood as the best in the metropolis,
the members were attached to each other, trusting each
other through life, leaving each other legacies at death.
How much did he owe to the expression and inspiration of
his fellows, especially of Richard Burbage?</p>

<p>It is not too much to believe that without Richard to
translate him, he would not have thought of putting on
paper his great tragic characters, Othello, Hamlet, Richard
III.</p>

<p>He was <i>fortunate</i>, too, in his theatres. The best of their
time, they were worth writing for. Unhampered by much
stage mechanism, and with no scene shifting, he made his
audience co-operate with him through their imagination,
and create for themselves the scenery from his suggestions.
No interruptions, no intervals for irrelevant conversation
drifted men away from the developments of the central and
side plots which animated the stage continuously. The progress
of a play necessitated one continued process of attention;
and through educating his hearers to his level, he
came to reign supreme, playing upon their heart strings,
and moving them to mirth, woe, sympathy, wonder, repulsion,
or admiration as he pleased, in a way that we do not
understand to-day.</p>

<p>In another, laudable but more prosaic, aspect, Shakespeare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
was <i>fortunate</i>, in making money. Trained by the
pinch of early poverty, by the humiliations of his father’s
debts, by the constant demands of a young family, to estimate
its value as a means to any end, he seems to have
lost no chance of earning money, and by a self-denying
life, to have economized his gains. Thereby he was able to
rehabilitate his parents in their old position, to secure them
a grant of arms, to place his own family out of the reach of
the deprivations he must have suffered himself, and to have
lived and died in dignity and honour.</p>

<p><i>Fortunate</i> in the decline of his life, when his warfare was
over and his conquest won, he came back to dwell in the
place of his birth, beside the wife of his youth, his daughters,
and his wide circle of friends. And when the end
came, it was fortunate too. He had been allowed to finish
his task, and yet he had not overlived his powers. He did
not live <i>too long</i>, as Bacon did. His fellow townsmen did
not approve of plays any more than did the Corporation of
London, but they saw the playwriter reverently laid to rest
in the chancel of their parish church as owner of their
tithes. The inartistic monument, and the artistic epitaph
were raised by loving hearts to “Shakespeare, with whome
Quick nature dide.”</p>

<p>Need more be said as to Shakespeare’s fortunes? It is
not given to all great men to fit the time and to find the
chance to prove what is in them, and to win success. It is
not the fortune of every genius even, however associated
with great deeds, to reveal the spirit of his country, and to
be the voice of his age, which he helped to make what it
was. Yet that was Shakespeare’s fortune and our inheritance,
and for this the whole world honours him to-day.</p>

SNITTERFIELD PROPERTY</span></h2></div>


<p>Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps did much for the
general reading public in bringing to their attention
so many of the estate records which help to clear the position
and the relations of the Arden and Shakespeare
families. Having done so much, it were well that he had
done more. Though he devoted his life and means to collecting
information, he published many of his discoveries
in little books of limited issue, accessible only to few, and
he did not always carry them over to his “Life of Shakespeare,”
or to his much more exhaustive “Outlines of the
Life of Shakespeare.” Even in the last edition of that great
work we suffer somewhat from the method of arrangement,
from a very imperfect and unsatisfactory Index, from an
absence of definite references, and even, it must be confessed,
from occasional carelessness and incompleteness in
his research among, and analyses of, the documents. He
had the great good fortune to have early access to the
Stratford records. Some of these were then in loose
bundles, others bound in books, without any attention to
order or date. He made a Calendar of these, but only in
the order he found them, and did not provide an index of
any kind, beyond, as I found later, a separate private
booklet, limited to “ten copies,” so that any student who
wishes to know what has been preserved must read through
the whole bulky folio volume. Probably on account of
these difficulties, or through blind faith in his work, none<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
of his successors—not even the industrious G. R. French—has
followed him to his originals or checked his inferences
by facts.</p>

<p>It seemed therefore worth while to go back to the manuscripts
themselves, and to work through them collectively
and chronologically, separating the results apart from the
mere verbiage of legal documents. Something has been
gained thereby, not only in exactitude, and in the recognition
of the bearing of one fact upon another, but also
several new papers have been unearthed and a few facts
have been gleaned, even at this late day, and in this well-worked
field.</p>

<p>The earliest record of the Snitterfield property which
concerns the Ardens, is, as Halliwell-Phillipps states (“Outlines,”
9th edit., ii, 207), Mayowe’s transfer of land in Snitterfield,
May, 16 Hen. VII, <i>i.e.</i> 1501. This is not given <i>in
extenso</i> in the “Outlines,” and I made a translation of it
for “The Genealogical Magazine,” 1899, p. 401, reproduced
in my “Shakespeare’s Family,” p. 29. I afterwards found
that it had appeared in “A New Boke about Shakespeare,
J. O. Halliwell, 1850.” But its importance was not explained.
A messuage with all its appurtenances, situated
between the land of John Palmer on one side, and a lane
called Merellane on the other, and extending from the
king’s highway to the rivulet, had been handed over by
John Mayowe, through his attorneys, Thomas Clopton of
Snitterfield, gent., and John Porter of Ardern, to six men,
named in full. The witnesses were John Wagstaff of Aston
Cantlowe, Robert Porter of Snitterfield, Richard Rushby
of Snitterfield, Richard Atkyns of Wilmecote, John
Alcokkes of Newnham, and others. The names of the six
feoffees were Robert Throckmorton, arm. (knighted that
same year); Thomas Trussell of Billesley, arm.; Roger
Reynolds of Henley-in-Arden; William Wood or Woodhouse;
Thomas Arden of Wilmecote, and Robert Arden,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
his son. After events make it seem probable that this was
a purchase desired by Thomas Arden for his son, who may
then have been under age and required trustees. No one
has noted fully that the others must have been the most
trusted friends of Thomas Arden, if not relatives or connections
by marriage. Indeed, if we might read into this
the ordinary meaning of such arrangements, it might be
supposed that the unknown wife of Thomas Arden was a
Throckmorton, and the unknown first wife of Robert Arden
a Trussell. This same Robert Throckmorton was, about
the same time, made trustee for his children, by Sir John
Arden of Park Hall (see my “Shakespeare’s Family,”
p. 184). Thomas Trussell was of a distinguished old family,
and the other two feoffees were gentlemen; so when Halliwell-Phillipps
scorned the notion of the Ardens of Wilmecote
being associated with gentility, he showed that he had
missed the full import of this deed, Misc. Doc., ii, 83.</p>

<p>The meaning of two other deeds was not revealed to him
at all, because each bore an error on its brow. The first is
among the Birthplace Deeds, in duplicate 424 and 425, and
dated “19 Hen. VI.,” rendered in pencil 1440. Therefore
it has been neglected. It seemed of too old date to concern
the Ardens. But it can be proved that the date should
have been entered rather as 19 Hen. VII, a mistake having
been made somehow.</p>

<p>It is the grant from William Mayowe to John Mayowe
of Snitterfield, son and heir of Richard Mayowe, of a messuage
with appurtenances lying between Marye Lane on
the one hand, and the land of John Palmer on the other.
The witnesses were William Wylmecote of the Wold,
William Ketall, “Richard Parson of Heyth,” Thomas Palmer
of Snitterfield, and William Wormbarn; dated Snitterfield,
Tuesday after Christmas, 27th December, 19 Hen. VII,
<i>i.e.</i> 1503. As this is <i>later</i> than the deed by which John
Mayowe transferred this property to the feoffees, it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
seem to imply that John Mayowe was under age in 1501,
or that some doubt as to his title had arisen. This opinion
is supported by the next deed, which Halliwell-Phillipps
must have glanced at, as he has calendared it, but cannot
have read, because he describes it without comment as
“Grant from John Mayhow of Snitterfield to <i>Thomas
Arthur</i>,” Misc. Doc., ii, 4. This has been referred to by no
one else. But it is evidently the real sale, the final concord.
The property is the same. Here are no trustees, no attorneys;
it is the definite deed of man to man. John Mayowe,
probably surrendering William Mayowe’s grant to himself
made six months before, confirmed to <i>Thomas Arthurn</i>
(not Arthur) of Wilmecote and his heirs the messuage,
with eighty acres of land in Snitterfield, with the same
boundaries as before, the only variation being between
“the land held by <i>William</i> Palmer on the one hand,
and the lane called <i>Mary’s Lane</i> on the other.” John
Mayowe set his seal to this before the witnesses, Thomas
Clopton, gent. (who had been his attorney in 1501), Robert
Porter, Thomas Nicholson, Hugh Townsend, John Scoryer,
John Palmer, jun., John Pardy, and many others, 6th July
19 Hen. VII (<i>i.e.</i> 1504). The spelling of the name need
perplex no one who understands the loose orthography of
the time, and knows that “Arden” was frequently spelt
“Arderne.”</p>

<p>This was evidently the most important purchase made
by Thomas Arden. It was the property let, at some unascertained
date between this and 1529, to Richard Shakespeare,
and concerning which, nigh eighty years afterwards,
John and Henry Shakespeare, sons of Richard,
were summoned to give evidence in the Chancery suit
brought by Thomas Mayowe against the Ardens.</p>

<p>The next purchase was by Robert Arden, though we know
from the Subsidies and the Court Rolls that his father was
yet alive. Richard Rushby and his wife Agnes, daughter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
and heiress of William Harvey, yielded to Robert Arden a
tenement and lands between the tenement of Richard
Hardyng on the one side, and the land of the Lord of the
manor upon the other. The witnesses were Richard Grant,
gent.; “Rogero Palmer, chapelin”; John Pardy, and many
others. Dated at Snitterfield 14th December 11 Hen. VIII,
<i>i.e.</i>, 1519 (Misc. Doc., ii, 9). Another copy of the same
date is preserved as Misc. Doc., ii, 59; and still another
among the Wheler MSS. at the Birthplace, i, 23 (S. 172),
dated 21st December 11 Hen. VIII. Two years later Richard
Rushby of Snitterfield handed over to Robert Arden of
Wylmecote a general release of this same property, dated
at Wilmecote 29th December 13 Hen. VIII, <i>i.e.</i> 1521 (Misc.
Doc., ii, 81).</p>

<p>There is no suggestion of the third and fourth boundaries
of this purchase, except through the description of
the next. Birthplace Deed 428 is a release from John
Palmer of Snitterfield, son and heir of John Palmer and
Elizabeth his wife, daughter of John Harvey, formerly of
Snitterfield, to Robert Ardern, of one tenement and divers
lands and pastures between the tenement of Richard
Hardyng on the one side, and the land of the Lord on the
other—the third and fourth boundaries being again omitted.
Witnesses, Richard Hawe of Warwick, gent.; Richard
Fyssher, Under-Bailiff of Warwick; Will Holbache, John
Parker of Grove Park, Walter Nicholson, John Townsend,
and Richard Maydes, 1st October 21 Hen. VIII, <i>i.e.</i> 1529.
This land was the fourth boundary of the purchase from
Mayowe, and probably united it with the Rushby purchase,
coming also through the Harveys. Both properties lay
between the tenement of Harding and the land of the Lord
of the manor, and seem to have been side by side. The
addition must have greatly improved the value of the
Mayowe inheritance. Fragments of information come to
us from the Subsidy Rolls (192/128) and the Court Rolls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
of the College of St. Mary in Warwick, Portfolio 207, 88.
Richard Rushby and William Mayowe seem to have stayed
on in the village. John Palmer was generally “tithing-man.”
In 17 Hen. VIII Thomas Arden was presented for
owing suit of court, and William Mayowe because he
should cut Eight Leas Hedge. We do not know how much
sooner he had come to reside in Snitterfield, but we find
that Richard Shackspere was presented by John Palmer in
20 Hen. VIII, for owing suit of court. He was again presented
for the same neglect, 22 Hen. VIII, excused
23 Hen. VIII, and John Palmer reported that “all was
well” till 28 Hen. VIII. Then Thomas Palmer presented
“William Mayhew and Rich. Shakspere for default of
suit of court.” Again in 30 Hen. VIII, “Robine Ardern,
Richard Shackspere, and William Mayhew owe suit of
court, and are amerced; and Richard Shakespeare must
mend the hedge between him and Thomas Palmer under
a penalty of 40 pence.” In 33 Hen. VIII, “William
Mayhewe, Richard <i>Shakeschafte</i>, and Roben Ardern owe
suit of court, and are amerced; and Roben Ardern must
mend his hedge between him and John Palmer under a
penalty of 20 pence.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Robert Arden had married, and was bringing
up a large family of daughters, and his wife died while
some of them were yet young. The next thing I have
learnt of him is through the Court Rolls of Katharine the
Queen at Balsale, Portfolio 207 (9), the View of Frankpledge,
21st April 2 Ed. VI (1548): “To this court came
Agnes Hill, widow, and prayed licence to marry one
Robert Ardern, which was granted in the name of the
Lady the Queen, by her seneschal,” on the payment of a
fee of five shillings. Her husband John Hill of Bearley had
died in 1545, leaving her executrix. Her marriage probably
took place very soon after the licence was granted.</p>

<p>Robert Arden may have made other arrangements before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
this, but nothing is preserved earlier than the settlement
of 17th July 4 Ed. VI (1550). He then enfeoffed Adam
Palmer of Aston Cantlow and Hugh Porter of Snitterfield
in the tenement and land now in the occupation of Richard
Shakespeare, in trust for himself and his wife Agnes for
life, with the remainder of a third part to his daughter
Agnes Stringer,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> now wife of Thomas Stringer, formerly
wife of John Hewins, defunct, of Bearley; another third
part to his daughter Joan, the wife of Edmund Lambert,
Barton-on-the-Heath; and another third to his daughter
Katharine, wife of Thomas Edkins of Wylmecote (Misc.
Doc., ii, 21; see also Misc. Doc., ii, 79). These three elder
daughters evidently had the best part of their father’s
property, bordering on the high road, a stream, and a lane,—all
conveniences; its size about 80 acres.</p>

<p>On the same day, 17th July 1550, there was drawn up a
tripartite indenture by Robert Arden, confirming Adam
Palmer and Hugh Porter in the possession of a messuage
and three “quatrones terre,” etc., now in the tenure of
Richard Henley, to the use of Robert Arden himself and
his wife Agnes for their lives, and after that a third part to
go to his daughter Margaret Webbe, the wife of Alexander
Webbe of Bearley; another third to his daughter Joyce;
and another third to his daughter Alice (Misc. Doc., ii, 77).
Another copy is preserved in the same series, ii, 79. A
similar deed in Misc. Doc., ii, 73, is dated six months
later (17th December, 4 Ed. VI, 1550). This seems to
have been the property Robert had bought from the
Rushbys, but whether it included that formerly owned by
the Palmers is not quite clear. The boundary line and
the number of acres are not defined, and sometimes there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
were three tenants, and sometimes two, in the combined
property.</p>

<p>Robert Arden made his will 24th November 1556, and
died before 17th December following. He left his wife Agnes,
as we have seen, a life interest in the shares of all his
daughters at Snitterfield, and a place of residence in the
copyhold of Wilmecote, to be shared “peaceably” with his
daughter Alice, under a penalty. Mary was to inherit
Asbies, an independent farm of over 60 acres in Wilmecote,
and she and Alice were to be joint executors of their
father’s will. This shows that they were both grown up,
though still unmarried, and suggests that Arden had had
some disappointment in his second marriage, thus to pass
over his wife to leave things in charge of his daughters.</p>

<p>John Shakespeare must shortly after have married Mary
Arden, though no record of the marriage has as yet been
found.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Hugh Porter, one of the feoffees, died in 1557, leaving
Adam Palmer alone as trustee.</p>

<p>On 21st May 2 Eliz. (1560), Agnes Arden granted to her
brother Alexander Webbe of Bearley, husband of her stepdaughter
Margaret, a lease<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> for forty years, at 40<i>s.</i> a year,
of the Snitterfield estate, two messuages, a cottage, and a
yard and a half of arable land, etc., “in the occupation of
Richard Shakespeare, John Henley, and John Hargreave,”
in presence of John Somerville and other witnesses (Birthplace
Deeds, 429).</p>

<p>No one has noted how seriously this may have affected
Richard Shakespeare. He may have been an aged man,
ready to resign his life-work, or he may not. It is not likely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
that Webbe’s removal from Bearley to Snitterfield could
have taken place before November of that year; possibly
another year’s grace was granted. But we do know that
either in December 1560 or January 1560-1 Richard
Shackspere of Snytterfield died, and his goods were administered
by his son John, then called “Agricola”
10th February 1560-1 (see Worcester Probate Registry,
“Testamenta”).</p>

<p>There is proof that Alexander Webbe did leave Bearley
and settle down on his lease farm at Snitterfield, a
share of which would revert to himself, through his wife
Margaret, on the death of his sister Agnes. He strengthened
his position when, on 12th February 11 Eliz. (1568-9),
Thomas Stringer of Stocton in the county of Salop, yeoman,
let to Alexander Webbe of Snitterfield, husbandman,
and Margaret his wife, the third part of one messuage, etc.,
with a yard of land, etc. now in the occupation of the said
Alexander, with all the interest he has in another tenement
and half yardland now in the occupation of John Henley,
to hold, after the decease of Agnes Arden, for the term of
twenty-one years. Webbe was to pay to Thomas Stringer
and his heirs 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> at the two terms of the year. If Alexander
Webbe failed to pay, the Stringers might eject him.
“Witnesses, John Shakespere, Henry Russell, Richard
Boyse, and James Hilman, this writer” (Misc. Doc., ii, 15,
not signed by the Stringers). A bond is also drawn up
between them that if Thomas Stringer does not fulfil his
agreement, he should forfeit £7; same date, with same
witnesses (Misc. Doc., ii, 78).</p>

<p>Alexander Webbe was buried at Snitterfield 17th April
1573, and “John Shackspere” was the overseer of his will.
His widow Margaret shortly afterwards married Edward
Cornwell. The first reference I have found to him is in a
deed of exchange (Misc. Doc., vii, 41), which has not been
noted, between Bartholomew Hales, Lord of the Manor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
and certain freeholders in Snitterfield, <i>i.e.</i>, “Sir John
Spencer; Thomas Feryman, ‘clarke,’ Vicar of the Parish
Church; Edward Graunt, gent.; John Pardy; Robert
Maydes; John Tombes and Elizabeth his wife; John
Walker; Edward Cornewell and Margaret his wife; Thomas
Stringer; Thomas Palmer; William Perckes and Marjory
his wife, Thomas Harding, and Edward Watersonne, freeholders
of and within the said manor, 23rd January 17 Eliz.
(1575).”</p>

<p>There had been certain exchanges of the common lands
between the farmers and the manor, but they were unsure
in law. By this indenture it is covenanted that Bartholomew
Hales and Mary his wife and their heirs shall grant to the
freeholders and their heirs, by way of exchange, all the
lands, meadows, commons, pastures, and feeding commodities
now in the tenure of Edward Grant in Rowley Field;
and the “four yarde land,” late in the occupation of Bartholomew
Hales, lying in Gallow Hill Field, Rowley Field,
and Brookfield (except as reserved for certain tenants in
beast pasture and three-horse pasture during their several
terms); and all the lands in the common called Griswold
or Bushe Field, and all the meadow ground with the
“hades” in Aston Meadow and Errymarsh Meadow. And
the Lord agreed that after the hay is mown and carried
away from the common meadow called Broad Meadow, the
customary tenants, without let, shall enjoy the aftermath
of the said parcel of meadows for ever: And as there are
so many conies in Rowley Field, to the annoyance of the
tenants, they shall be allowed to kill and destroy or take
the said conies wherever their corn shall grow. He further
grants that one “hade land” (10 ridges) being in Coplowes
next Parsons, otherwise called Burges Hedge there, and
shooting down into the way after Luscombe Hedge, shall
be for ever a common way to bring, lead, or carry hay out
of Aston Meadow with horse, cart, or “wayne.” The freeholders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
grant in exchange certain ground called Common
Fields or Wallfields, one close called the Parkepitt, one
field called the New Lessowe or Brunthill, a pasture called
Coplow and a meadow, a parcel of ground called Hollowe
Meadowe, and one Lammas Close near the house of
Margery Lynsycombe; also the Common Leys lying between
Hollow Meadow and Ingon Gate, shooting up by
Stratford Way Pit to the ground of William Cookes, containing
by estimation 200 acres; and certain ground lying
in the Hillfield where the windmill standeth, and the parish
meadow, and all other commons, woods, furzes, etc., of the
said freeholders. If either party break the agreement, the
other may enter into the possession of the old lands so
exchanged.</p>

<p>A long series of deeds follow this, most of which were
known to Halliwell-Phillipps. On 12th October 18 Eliz.
(1576), Edward Cornwell of Snitterfield, husbandman, and
Margaret his wife, assigned to Robert Webbe, husbandman,
their interest in two messuages with a cottage, and
the lease granted by Agnes Arden to his father (see Birthplace
Deeds, 429). The witnesses were Gualterus Roche,
Nicholas Knolles, clerk, and Thomas Nycolls (Birthplace
Deeds, 430).</p>

<p>On 16th October 18 Eliz. (1576), Thomas Stringer of
Stockton, co. Salop, and his sons John and Arden Stringer,
bargained and sold to Edward Cornwell and Margaret his
wife all the reversion which was the inheritance of Agnes,
late wife of Thomas Stringer, and daughter of Robert
Arden, deceased. A curious complexity comes in here, for
they also sell, as if they had bought it, “the residue of the
said tenements which late were the inheritance of Thomas
Edkyne and Katharine his wife, in the right of the said
Katharine.” The Stringers sell this double share for £68,
to be paid beforehand, and they agree that at Christmas
term next they shall sue out a fine of the parcel of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
premises of the said Thomas Edkins and his wife Katharine,
“if the said Katherine do so long live.” They have full
power to sell all, except the life interest of Agnes Arden.
They set their hands and seals to this, in the presence of
the same witnesses as last deed (Misc. Doc., ii, 10).</p>

<p>Another important step was taken on 20th November
21 Eliz. (1578), when Edward Cornwell of Snitterfield, yeoman,
and Margaret his wife, sold to Robert Webbe their
moiety of three messuages in Snitterfield for £100. This
seems to refer back to the last two agreements. Witnesses,
John Dafferne, Nicholas Knolles, Thomas Chamberlayne,
Hastings Aston, Will Cookes, Henry Talbot, and Thomas
Nicholson (Birthplace Deeds, 431). The bond from Edward
Cornwell to ensure the performance of the covenant was
signed the same day, before the same witnesses (Wheler
Papers, i, 34).</p>

<p>Another deed was drawn up on 23rd December 21 Eliz.
(1578), in which Thomas, John, and Arden Stringer, and
Thomas Edkins, gave up in perpetuity all their rights in
the third part of these messuages and lands to Robert
Webbe, the son of Margaret Cornwell. The signs of Thomas
and Arden Stringer with seals, and the <i>signature</i> of John
Stringer, follow this, but no allusion to Edkins (Misc. Doc.,
ii, 20).</p>

<p>There was a fine made between Robert Webbe and
Thomas Stringer the following Easter (Public Record
Office, Feet of Fines, Warr. Pasche, 15th June 21 Eliz.,
1579). The Stringers received £40 thereby; perhaps this
was only for their own share. There was no allusion to the
Edkins, so perhaps Katharine “did not so long live.” An
abstract of this fine is preserved in Misc. Doc., i, 92.</p>

<p>On the same day as the Stringers’ covenant, 23rd December
21 Eliz. (1578), there was a sale by Edward Cornwell to
Robert Webbe of all his goods and chattels in Snitterfield
or elsewhere, except “one young mare of color baye, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
one coaffer, parcel of the premises”—two pieces of pewter
being delivered in sign of possession. It was signed by the
mark and seal of witnesses, Anthony Osbaston, William
Round, Ardenne Stringer, and John Bronde (Birthplace
Deed, 432).<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The next deeds concern the Shakespeare transfer, about
which there is much contentious matter. Halliwell-Phillipps
says, “Outlines,” i, 29, “Arden had reserved to his daughter
Mary a portion of a large estate at Snitterfield.” Now this
is a pure supposition, unsupported by any deed or transfer,
and besides, it is an unnecessary supposition. It may be
noted that there is no allusion to Joyce and Alice, or their
shares, among the transfers. It is <i>probable</i> that they died
without heirs of their body, and that their shares were
divided among their sisters. It is <i>possible</i> that Alice, with
whom she had been most associated, might have <i>left</i> her
share to her sister Mary. However it happened, Mary
was empowered to sell. In “Outlines,” ii, 179, the indenture
is given <i>in extenso</i>, as drawn up on the 15th day of October
21 Eliz. (<i>i.e.</i>, 1579), between John Shackspere of Stratford-on-Avon,
yeoman, and Mary his wife, and Robert Webbe
of Snitterfield, witnessing that for the sum of “<i>foure pounds</i>”
paid by Robert Webbe to John and Mary Shakespeare
they should sell him “all that their moiety, part or partes,
be it more or lesse, of and in two tenements” with the appurtenances
in Snitterfield, all reversions, remainders,
grants (the rents to the chief lord alone excepted), and
all charters and evidences concerning them; and that John
and Mary should cause and suffer to be done every device
for the more perfect assurance of the aforesaid moiety to
Robert Webbe, “by his or their counsell learned in the
law.” They also agreed to deliver to Robert Webbe by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
the following Easter all their “evidences.” In witness
whereof the parties put their hands and seals, John Shackspere,
Mary Shackspere, in presence of Nicholas Knooles,
Vicar of Auston, William Maydes, Anthony Osbaston, and
others. This long paper, written in English, has no reference,
but hangs framed on the west wall in the Birthplace
Museum. A bond was also signed concerning this on
25th October in the same year, by the same parties, and
witnesses, that if John and Mary Shackspere fail in the
performance of their agreement, they will pay 20 marks to
Robert Webbe; but if they perform the conditions, the
bond will be held void. This bond also hangs framed on
the west wall among the Birthplace Deeds in the Museum.
The final concord is found among the Feet of Fines in
the Record Office,“Warr. Pasche in quindecim dies 22
Eliz.” (<i>i.e.</i> 1580), six months after the agreement. “Robert
Webbe qu., John Shackespere and Mary his wife def., ...
of the sixth part of two parts of two messuages,” etc., in
Snitterfield; they yielding up their share entirely to
Robert Webbe, on the death of Agnes Arden, for <i>forty
pounds</i>.</p>

<p>This is transcribed in full by Halliwell-Phillipps, “Outlines,”
ii, 176; but he says, “The indenture leading the
uses of this fine has not been discovered,” assuming that
there is no connection between this fine and the agreement
of 15th October, which he takes to be a sale by John Shakespeare
alone of some property of his own, in which he
only uses his wife’s name to bar dower. Careful study will
show that these three documents all concern the same
sale. The puzzle is, Why did the English scribe write
“foure” pounds, while the Latin <i>foot</i> gives “forty.” It may
in one case have been merely a scribe’s error of “foure”
for “fouretie”; it may, in another case, point to the result
of some increase of the part to be sold, possibly by the
death of another sister within the six months; it may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
that Robert Webbe wished to let John Shakespeare have
enough to pay the mortgage on Asbies, trusting to future
good offices; it may be that the “learned counsel” employed
put up the price for his clients before the final
concord. Or it may be that the “foure pounds” referred
to the share by division of one sister’s property; and the
other to the whole share by will. An abstract of the fine
remains, incorrectly dated, in Misc. Doc., i, 90.</p>

<p>Among the Fines de Banco, “Warr. 22 Eliz., pro termino
Pasche,” is the note of one due to George Digby, arm., for
a licence to Robert Webbe to agree with John Shakespeare
and others for his share of the property in Snitterfield,
6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> “Recepta per me, Johannem Cowper Sub-Vice-comitum.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Arden renewed the lease she had made to her
brother Alexander to his son Robert Webbe, 5th July 1580
(Misc. Doc., i, 88). Witnesses John Somerville, Thomas
Osbardistone.</p>

<p>It would seem that the question of the ownership of the
Snitterfield property was perplexing enough to Robert
Webbe, when a new claimant appeared. Thomas Mayowe
of Shireburne, grandson of the William Mayowe who had
granted it to John at the beginning of the century, laid
claim to it now, and having no title deeds, appealed to Sir
Thomas Bromley, Lord Chancellor. He stated that his
grandfather William was lawfully seised in one messuage
with about 80 acres in Snitterfield by ancient gift in tail
made to him by Richard Mayowe his father; and that
this descended to Roger Mayowe, son and heir of William,
and should have descended to the suppliant Thomas, son
and heir of Roger. But</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p0">the deeds and charters concerning the premises of right belonging
to your suppliant have casually come into the hands of Edward
Cornewell, Agnes Arden, and Robert Webbe, who, by colour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
thereof, daily devise and practise to convey to themselves
sundry estates in those by inheritance to persons unknown to
your suppliant, minding, through delays, wrongfully to disinherit
him.</p>
</div>

<p>He did not know the dates of the old deeds, nor the
certain number of them, “whether in chiste locked, or
boxe sealed”; and therefore he is without all remedies by
the ordinary course of the common law. He knows not
with certainty against whom to bring the action, for “they
so covertly and secretly do use the matter that he cannot
certeynely know who is the tenant of the premises or
receiver of the rents.” So he appeals to the Chancellor to
issue a writ of subpœna, that Edward Cornewell, Agnes
Arden, and Robert Webbe should appear personally before
his Honour, to give an account of their claims. This is
not dated (Misc. Doc., vii, 154). It must have fallen like
a bomb into the camp in 1580. Agnes Arden was still
alive, but she was ill. A commission was granted to
Bartholomew Hales, gent., Lord of the Manor of Snitterfield,
and Nicholas Knolles, clerk, to take the deposition
of Agnes Arden, now impotent, for the use of Chancery,
in answer to a bill by Thomas Mayowe, 25th November
23 Eliz., 1580 (Misc. Doc., ii, 13).</p>

<p>As they lived so near, this was probably seen to at once.
Agnes Arden died shortly afterwards, and was buried at
Aston Cantlow, 29th December 1580, Her death caused a
re-arrangement of claims. From tenants, the Ardens had
become owners in each part. Robert Webbe, already
owner of the bulk of the estate, proceeded to purchase
more. Edmund Lambert, who had not been pressed by
poverty to realize his reversion, agreed to sell his share.
On 1st May 23 Eliz. (1581), there was granted to Robert
Webbe, by Edmund Lambert of Barton in Henmarche,
and his wife Joan, one of the daughters of Robert Arden,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
all their moiety, part, pourpart, or share of the property
for £40 (Misc. Doc., ii, 80).</p>

<p>On the 2nd of May a subordinate deed was drawn up,
signed by the <i>marks</i> and seals of Edmund and Joan
Lambert, appointing their well-beloved William Cookes
and William Meades their true and legitimate attorneys
to hand over their third part to Robert Webbe, or any
attorney he may choose. This was signed in the presence
of William Cookes, Thomas Nicholson, William Maydes,
John Perkes, and Edward Cornewell (Misc. Doc., ii, 12).</p>

<p>On the same date, with the same witnesses, Edmund
Lambert executed a bond of £80 in favour of Robert
Webbe if he should not fulfil the conditions agreed upon
(Misc. Doc., vii, 153).</p>

<p>A general release by Edmund Lambert to Robert Webbe
of the interest of him and his wife in the Snitterfield
property was handed over on 1st June 23 Eliz. (1581), before
the witnesses John Dafferne, John Scarlett, Edward
Cornewell, Henry Talbot, and John Butler. The seal has
H. T. on it, probably being that of Henry Talbot (Misc.
Doc., ii, 84). See also Birthplace Deeds, Appendix 276.</p>

<p>The final concord appears in the Feet of Fines, P.R.O.,
“Warr. Pasche, 24 Eliz.,” between “Robert Webbe, qu., et
Edmund Lambert et aliis deforc., de terre,” etc. Robert
Webbe had by this time become apparent owner of the
whole of the old Mayowe property, and empowered to
face the lagging Chancery suit alone.</p>

<p>But another complexity had arisen, and a new set of
deeds, which have not yet been fully worked out. Robert
Webbe was about to marry Mary, the daughter of John
Perkes of Snitterfield, evidently a prosperous farmer and
an affectionate father. The arrangements were extraordinary.
There is an undated deed (with pieces cut out)
providing that William Perkes should enjoy one tenement,
one orchard, and all appurtenances, etc., now in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
possession of Edward Cornewell, with no claims from the
Ardens, for the sum of £20; that if William Perkes <i>or his
assigns</i> do not enjoy the same and pay for it at the rate of
£3 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> a year, and do depart, then the said Edward
Cornwell to have the same again (Misc. Doc., ii, 7). This
seems to have been some first draft.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The “settlement” <i>in
extenso</i> is preserved between Robert Webbe and Mary
Perkes, 1st September 23 Eliz. (1581). In consideration of a
marriage hereafter to be held between them, and also in
consideration of £35 of lawful English money to be paid
him by John Perkes, Robert Webbe devised and let to
farm two messuages with the appurtenances, and one yard
land and a half, to John Perkes from the feast of St.
Michael for six years, to have and to hold, paying to
Robert Webbe or his executors the sum of fourpence at
each term. John Perkes was to repair the premises at his
own cost, and at the end of the term to yield them to
Robert Webbe. During that term Robert Webbe should
have twenty sheep kept for him during the winter months
by John Perkes;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p0">and the said John Perkes shall find and allow for the said Robert
Webbe; Mary the daughter of John Perkes, his wife; Margaret,
mother to the said Robert; and Edward Cornell, father-in-law to
the said Robert, during the term, within the dwellinghouse of the
said John Perkes, necessary, convenient, and holesome meate,
drinke, chamber lodging, and fier, at the proper cost and charge
of the said John Perkes, the said Edward Cornell paying for his
bording as aforesaid, yearelie to John Perkes, the some of three
pounds of English money. And if it haps that the said Robert
Webbe and Mary his wife have any child or children during the
said term, John Perkes shall find and allow for the same, meat,
drink, chamber lodging, and fier, with free entry in and out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
said chamber, to and for the said Robert, Mary, Margaret, Edward,
and the said children.</p>
</div>

<p>At the end of the term John Perkes was to yield up the
land sown with all manner of corn and grain at his own
charge, so that the said Robert and Mary should have it
for their own use after the six years. In witness whereof
both parties set their hands and seals in the presence of
Thomas Nicholson, Edward Cornewell, and Thomas Pittes
(Misc. Doc., ii, 14). On the same day, and before the same
witnesses, Robert Webbe signed a covenant, on his marriage
with Mary, daughter of John Perkes, to hold a messuage
in Snitterfield to the use of himself for life, with remainder
to Mary for life, with remainder to the right heirs.</p>

<p>It is evident that grim economy was necessary to
Robert Webbe, after his efforts to buy up the other shares,
and sit free on his grandfathers property. This was intensified
by the unknown dangers and expenses of the
Chancery suit hanging over him. John Perkes had done
what he could to help him.</p>

<p>Still one other purchase, at least, had Robert Webbe to
make. Halliwell-Phillipps, “Outlines,” ii, 173, says: “How
Robert Arden’s other two daughters, Elizabeth Scarlett
and Mary Shakespeare, became entitled to portions, is not
known; but that this was the case can be shown by the
conveyances to Robert Webbe.” Elizabeth Scarlett is
referred to neither in Robert Arden’s will nor in the
settlement of 1550. It may be she was an elder daughter
who had received her portion at her marriage. She might
still share by common law in the inheritance of sisters who
died. Halliwell-Phillipps suggests that she had married
John Scarlett; but both the John Scarlett of Henry VIII
and the John of Elizabeth had wives named Joan. Halliwell-Phillipps
enters Elizabeth’s death in the Ardens’
pedigree table as in 1588, giving no authority. But John<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
would not have been heir to his mother in 1582 if she had
been alive. The Birthplace Deed 433 shows that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>John Skarlett of Newnham in the Parish of Aston Cantlow, husbandman,
son and heir of Elizabeth Skarlett, one of the daughters
and coheirs of Robert Arden of Wilmecote, in consideration of
20 marks paid him by Robert Webbe of Snitterfield, agreed that
all his part and interest in two messuages and their appurtenances</p>
</div>

<p class="p0">in Snitterfield should be delivered for ever to Robert
Webbe, 18th March 24 Eliz. (1581-2); witnesses John Dafferne,
John Butler, Edward Cornwell, and Edmund
Lamberde.</p>

<p>On the same day was sealed a bond for 40 marks, for
the completion of the sale between Robert Webbe and
John Scarlett of “all the part, purparte, title, and interest,
in two messuages in Snitterfield in the tenure of Robert
Webbe, of which John Skarlett and Joane his now wiefe,
or one of them, be lawful owners in fee simple”; the deed
of release to cover all rents due, that of the chief lord
excepted. The above-named John Scarlett and the said
Joane his wife to hand over all deeds and evidences (Misc.
Doc., ii, 74).</p>

<p>I came on this deed first (evidently unknown to Halliwell-Phillipps),
and naturally thought the inheritance lay
in Joane the wife; but in the light of the previous deed it
is clear that it came through his mother to John, and
Joane’s name was used only to bar dower. John Scarlett
received very much less than the Shakespeares did, which
strengthens my belief that Mary inherited a share of one
dead sister’s portion, but was left the whole portion of
another sister by some form of will. I find no mention of
the Scarletts’ sale among the Feet of Fines.</p>

<p>The most painstaking research among records, wills,
and registers has given me no clue to further information;
indeed, rather clouds what we already have. It is known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
that the Aston Cantlow registers do not begin early (1560).
Among the burials appear Joane, “wyff of John Scarlett,”
9th December 1580; and on 9th December 1581, John
Scarlett. The will of John Scarlett of Newnam is dated 10th
December 1581; in this he mentions his brother William, and
John, the son of Adam Scarlett. The date given is <i>the day
after his burial</i>; and the deed is drawn up three months after
both. This seems to prove that it was <i>another</i> John Scarlett.
Adam Scarlett, the richest yeoman<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> in the parish, had a
brother John, who might, by common law, as the <i>second</i>
son, have been heir to his mother, and who survived some
time after this. But no such explanation comes as to the
“now wife Joan,” who had died a year and more before the
agreement was made in which she is concerned. I have
been unable, as yet, to trace the cause of the discrepancies.</p>

<p>Robert Webbe had now got into his own hands all which
had been owned by his aunts and his mother. But the
Chancery proceedings were dragging their slow length
along. He could, however, have little fear, further than the
waste of time and money, as he would hold among his
evidences the two early papers which I have brought forward
for the first time. A paper in Misc. Doc., i, 89, gives
the list of “Witnesses to be examined for Robert Webbe.”
Among these is “Hary Shexspere.” Another (Misc. Doc.,
ii, 85) is the subpœna of John Shakspere, John Wager,
Adam Palmer, and others, in the case of Mayowe <i>versus</i>
Robert Webbe, to appear before a special commission
appointed by Chancery, Sir Fulke Greville, Sir Thomas
Lucy, Humphrey Peto, and William Clopton, 24 Eliz.</p>

<p>No one has hitherto taken any further trouble about this
Chancery suit, but, knowing that it might lead to unexpected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
revelations, I made a diligent search at the Record
Office, and was rewarded to a limited extent; that is, I
found some information, but not so much as I had hoped.</p>

<p>I found that a commission had been granted to hear
the case of Mayowe con. Cornwell and others, in the
Quindene of Trinity, to Sir Fulke Greville and Sir Thomas
Lucy, Knights, Humphrey Peto, Esq., and Thomas Clopton,
Arm., or any two of them, to hear the witnesses on the
plaintiffs’ side; record their answers, and give the defendants
a fortnight to reply, 12th June 23 Eliz. (1581).</p>

<p>Thomas Mayowe claimed to be the son of Roger, and
that Roger was the son and heir of William, on whom
Richard his father had entailed the property. Apparently
William had granted it to John, son and heir of Richard.
This John would be William’s brother. The interrogatories
to be put on behalf of Mayowe were necessarily long, but
they may be summarized. Do you know the tenement in
question, “lying between the house which was sometime
the house of William Palmer on the one side, and a lane
called Merrel Lane on the other, and doth abut on the
High Street”; and if one John Mayowe did sometime
dwell in it? Do you know that one Richard Mayowe deceased,
father of William Mayowe, likewise deceased, was
seised in this domain as of fee of inheritance, and did
entail it on the said William and the heirs of his body?
Do you know that William was grandfather of the complainant,
that his son and heir was Roger, and that Thomas
was the son and heir of Roger? Chancery is proverbially
slow. The depositions were taken at Warwick 13th June,
24 Eliz. (1582), before Sir Foulk Greville, Sir Thomas
Lucy, and Humfrey Peto, Esq. (Chanc. Dep. M. VIII, 22).
The question of entail is not cleared.</p>

<p>Richard Welmore of Norton Curlew, of the age of 60
years or thereabouts, did know the tenement, but could
not answer the other queries. He had heard Roger Mayowe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
say he was the eldest son of William. He knew that
Thomas was the son and heir of Roger.</p>

<p>Robert Nichols of Lillington, aged 67 years, knew the
plaintiff, the defendants, and the tenement, and “that it
abuts itself against the High Street.” He had heard by
credible report that John Mayowe did sometime dwell
there. He had also heard that Richard was seised in the
demesne as of fee of inheritance; that William was the
son of Richard, that Roger was the son of William, and
Thomas was son of Roger.</p>

<p>Thomas Lyncycome of Yardeley in the county of
Worcester, tilemaker, 58 years of age, only knew that
Thomas was eldest son and heir of Roger.</p>

<p>The depositions were signed by Fulke Greville and
Humphrey Peto. Rather an unsatisfactory plea against
possession for nigh eighty years! Doubtless the two
deeds were in court—the grant of William Mayowe to
John, son of Richard; and the sale by John Mayowe to
Thomas Arden.</p>

<p>Then follow “Interrogatories to be ministered on the
part and behalf of Edward Cornell, Robert Webbe, Edmund
Lambert, and Joane his wife.” These also must be
contracted, How many tenements are there in controversy?
How many inhabited them? How long have you known
them? Whose inheritance was it accounted? Was it the
inheritance of Arden? What was the name of Arden?
Have you ever known the ancestors of Mayowe occupy the
premises? How long since they did so? Do you know if
Robert Arderne of Wilmecote was seised in fee simple of
said premises? Do you know if said Robert made any conveyance,
and to what uses? Do you know if the persons
to whom the grant was made peaceably succeeded on his
death? Did Agnes Arderne, wife of the said Robert, occupy
the premises or receive rent for it? The replies were clear.</p>

<p>1. Adam Palmer of Aston Cantlow, yeoman, of the age<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
of 60 or thereabout, said that he knew both plaintiff and
defendant, that he has known the messuage in controversy
forty years and upwards, and that he was one of the feoffees
about thirty-six years ago. He knew one Richard Shaxpere
did occupy the same messuage as tenant to Robert Arderne
als Arden, and also Saunder Webbe and his wife, one
Cornwell, and now Robert Webbe, son to Saunder. He
hath known the said messuage and land to have been in
the quiet possession of Robert Arden and his wife Agnes,
as his own inheritance, and after his decease, of Saunder
Webbe, who married the daughter of Arden, and now of
Robert Webbe, who is in possession as heir to Saunder
Webbe. He never knew any of the ancestors of the complainant
dwell in the premises. Robert Arden was seised
in fee simple, and did in his lifetime make a conveyance
to Joan Lambert, Katherine Edkins, and Joyce Edkins,
his daughters and coheirs by the feoffment. The wife of
Robert Arderne quietly enjoyed the premises till of late,
within this two or three years, this complainant did make
some title thereto. To his remembrance Robert Arderne
died twenty-eight years since or thereabout. He knew that
Agnes, the wife of Robert Ardern, received the rents and
profits of the said messuage, 40<i>s.</i> by the yeare, and since
it hath been improved to £4 by the year, and that she died
about two years since.</p>

<p>2. The next witness called was John Henley of Snitterfield,
husbandman, of the age of eighty years or thereabout.
He knew both complainant and defendant, had known the
messuage for about sixty-six years, that it had been in the
quiet possession of Thomas Arderne alias Arden, father
to Robert Arderne; and concerning Robert Arden, he
said all that Adam Palmer said. He knew the inheritance
to be in the possession of Thomas Arderne, and afterward
of Robert Arden; he was witness to the possession-taking,
but cannot remember the time of the death of Arden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>3. Next was called John Wager of Snitterfield, husbandman,
of the age of 60 or thereabout. He knew both
complainant, defendants, and property. He knew one
Rushby and one Richard Shaxpere, one Alexander Webbe
and his wife, Cornwell and his wife, and Robert Webbe,
son to Alexander, to occupy the property. He hath known
it to be in the Ardens for fifty years, and that Robert was
seised in fee simple. He said the same as Adam Palmer,
though he was neither a feoffee nor was at the delivery of
seisin.</p>

<p>I had hoped to be able to turn the page and read
details of John Shakespeare’s age and status, and what he
had to say concerning Arden’s inheritance and his father’s
tenure. But the paper abruptly ends, without further
witness, and without signatures. No decree or order has
been preserved. Either the Court considered the Ardens’
case too strong to need further proof, or John too interested
for a witness, or the page was lost that bore his testimony,
as so much is lost concerning his family. The evidence of
continued possession shows what the decision of the
Court was.</p>

<p>There is only one perplexing statement of Adam
Palmer’s further to note. We have the deeds, and we know
that this, formerly Mayowe’s property, when in the tenure
of Richard Shakespeare was settled by Robert Arden
on his daughters Agnes Stringer, Joane Lambert, and
Katherine Edkins; while Palmer names them as Joan
Lambert, Katherine Edkins, and Joyce Edkins. It was
easy at the end of thirty-six years to forget which of the
daughters had her share in this messuage, seeing they all
really treated their shares, not as the third part of one, but
as the sixth part of the two properties. Agnes Stringer
had died long before, and her family lived in Shropshire.</p>

<p>But it is more puzzling to hear Palmer name “Joyce
Edkins,” as it seems to imply that Joyce, as well as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
Katharine, had married an Edkins. I have made careful
researches in every possible direction, but have been unable
to trace a Joyce Edkins, except the sister of William
Hill. I am inclined, therefore, to think that either Adam
Palmer or the clerk slipped in giving the name of Edkins
to Joyce, as well as to Katharine. She should have been
Joyce Arden with her share in the other property. The
fate of Joyce has yet to be discovered, if she was not
buried, as I suggested was possible, in Pedmore, in 1557
(see my “Shakespeare’s Family,” p. 181).</p>

<p>Perhaps Adam Palmer’s responsibilities had worn him
out, and he had begun to mix things up, though in other
points his testimony was clear. It was well for Robert
Webbe that he was then alive. He was buried at Aston
Cantlow, 13th July 1584.</p>

<p>Though this Chancery case does not yield us much new
matter, it makes real our somewhat hazy notions of the
property settled on Shakespeare’s aunts. But the whole
series of documents, taken together, teach us a great many
important points regarding the poet’s family and surroundings.
It lets us picture the house abutting on the High
Street where John Shakespeare was doubtless born, the
extent of the united properties, and the stretches of the
common fields which the poet doubtless haunted in his
youth to catch the conies, permitted to the freeholders.
But, above all, it answers conclusively the question, so
mockingly put by the Baconians, Where did the Stratford
man learn his law? There are more legal documents concerning
this Snitterfield property than were drawn up for
any other family of the time in Warwickshire, as anyone
may test who wades through the “Feet of Fines,” and as
few of his relatives could write, it is possible they could
not read. William Shakespeare may have had but little
Latin, but he was very likely esteemed as the scholar of
the family, and doubtless had all these deeds by heart,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
through reading them to his anxious and careful relatives
when they were brought out of the “box of evidences,” to
strengthen the case for the defendant against Thomas
Mayowe. The law papers of the Ardens, and the litigation
of his father, prepared him alike for his many later personal
associations with the law, and for the conduct of the
Chancery case which he hugged to his heart during ten
years at least. I trust soon to follow this out.</p>

<p>The story of Shakespeare’s lost inheritance is the clue
to the shaping of the poet’s life, and therefore it is
worth gleaning every scrap of information concerning it.
What is commonly known is, that Robert Arden, of Snitterfield
and Wilmecote, had made his will in 1556, leaving
the first (or the reversion of it after his wife’s death) to be
divided among six of his daughters.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Another daughter,
Elizabeth Scarlet, seems to have been otherwise provided
for, and the youngest daughter Mary, either because she
was his favourite, or because of the old Saxon preference
for the youngest child, was given the sole right in the freehold
at Wilmecote called Asbies. There is no record of its
purchase. My own opinion is that Thomas Arden, the
father of this Robert, was the second son of Sir Walter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
Arden of Park Hall, who was to receive, by his father’s
will in 1502, ten marks a year for life, his younger brothers
receiving five marks a year. They all seem to have been
provided for beyond this meagre allowance. At the date
of the will Thomas was already resident in Wilmecote. How
and why he went there is the question. Aston Cantlow had
long been part of the inheritance of the Beauchamps, who
intermarried with the Nevilles, and some connection of
the Beauchamps with the Ardens can be proved by the
family pedigree. Elizabeth Beauchamp was godmother to
Elizabeth Arden, Thomas Arden’s sister (as French believes),
and it is quite probable this little farm was given
to, or bought for, the settlement of, Thomas Arden. What
I wish to suggest is that Asbies was to the family the
cherished heirloom, the visible link of connection between
their branch and the historic family from which they
sprang, and that some family jealousy may have arisen
through its being absolutely left to the youngest child.</p>

<p>We know little about this Thomas, but much more about
his younger brother Robert. He was yeoman of the King’s
Chamber in Henry VII’s reign, and received many royal
patents and grants during the reigns of Henry VII and
Henry VIII. Leland mentions him: “Arden of the Court,
is younger brother to Sir John Arden of Park Hall”
(“Itin.,” vi, 20). Among the Feet of Fines for Warwickshire,
Trinity Term 18 Henry VIII, is an entry to the effect
that Robert Arden, Arm., settled an annuity on Antonio
Fitzherbert “from the Manor of Ward Barnes, formerly
Wilmecote”; whether this refers to the uncle, “Robert,
of the Court,” or the nephew, Robert of Wilmecote, it refers
to the district.</p>

<p>Now, it is not a little remarkable that the Shakespeares’
little property had only “a local habitation and a name”
of <i>Asbies</i>, during the life of Mary Arden and her immediate
Arden relatives. It is not known before, it has not been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
known since. Either it changed its name, or was swamped
in a larger estate. We cannot give its boundaries. Halliwell-Phillipps
shows that it could not have been by the
cottage <i>now</i> called Mary Arden’s Cottage<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> at Wilmecote,
for he had traced other owners back to 1561, but he seems
to think that Robert Arden had lived in Asbies. Now it
is quite clear from his will that his widow Agnes was to
have his <i>copy-hold</i> in Wilmecote, so that she allowed his
daughter Alice quietly to enjoy half, and it seemed they
had occupied that property. This copyhold was probably
for three lives, as it lapsed at Agnes Arden’s death in 1581,
<i>after</i> the trouble at Asbies.</p>

<p>On Mary’s marriage an interest in Asbies would accrue
to her husband, which by the courtesy of England he
would retain for life. During Shakespeare’s youth it would
be the basis of his father’s farming industries, and perhaps,
after the common fashion of the time, the prospective
source of support for the family, in a manner stigmatized
by the Earl of Leicester as lazy, selfish, and without public
spirit or family pride.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> It is perfectly certain it was intended
to be the inheritance of William Shakespeare, and
that he was prepared to be a small farmer, for which reason
he was not trained to any profession, nor apprenticed to any
trade. (All “traditions” on this question are untrustworthy.)</p>

<p>John Shakespeare had purchased in 1556, the year of
the settlement of Asbies, a house and garden in Greenhill
Street, Stratford-upon-Avon, and another in Henley Street,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
where he had been living since 1552 (see View of Frankpledge,
Borough of Stratford, P.R.O., Portfolio 207), so he
had a town home to offer the heiress of Asbies when he
married her the following year. He seemed, having been
Bailiff and Chief Alderman, to go on in prosperity till
October 1575, when he again purchased two houses in
Stratford, one of them also in Henley Street. From that
date his fortunes declined. Whether it was failure in the
wool industry, or the misfortunes of his brother Henry at
Ingon, or special losses of his own, John Shakespeare was
in money trouble by 1578. Some have suggested it was
through recusancy, because a much later State Paper list
gives his name among recusants. I have elsewhere shown
the John Shakespeare there mentioned was much more
likely to have been the shoemaker who disappeared shortly
after from the town. That the ex-Bailiff John’s difficulties
were well known, and that his fellow aldermen sympathized
with him, is shown in the Chamberlain’s accounts, where
John is excused by his brethren from the burdens they put
on themselves. He required money, and must have it
somehow. His nephew Robert Webbe had been prospering
in Snitterfield while he was declining, was, indeed,
stimulated by the ambition and help of a prospective
father-in-law, beginning to buy up the shares of his aunts
in Snitterfield. Mary Arden had been left no share there,
as Halliwell-Phillipps suggests, but apparently by this
date, through the death of her two next youngest sisters,
had become possessed of the share of the one by will, and
of the share of the other, without a will, by partition.</p>

<p>It is nearly certain that John and Mary Shakespeare
would have gone to Robert Webbe first for a loan on the
security of Snitterfield, or even to sell it outright. But he
had just bought in the share of the Stringers (see Feet of
Fines, Easter, 21 Eliz.), and would be short of money. They
turned to their brother-in-law Edmund Lambert, who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
sufficient money, but he would not trust it with John
Shakespeare in his depressed state on any lesser security
than that of the family jewel, of Asbies. He drew up an indenture,
purporting to be an absolute sale, for £40, with this
condition, that if the money was repaid on Michaelmas Day
1580 at Barton-on-the-Heath the sale was to be void. But
in the final concord, as preserved among the Feet of Fines
for Warwickshire, Easter 1579, there is no allusion to this
condition. Hence arose the trouble. When he had secured
the money, John made a very complex arrangement.
Asbies had evidently been leased to George Gibbes. He
found Thomas Webbe and Humphrey Hooper willing to
buy the lease from John and Mary Shakespeare and
George Gibbes for twenty-one years from 1580, and to
hand it back to George Gibbes. There must have been
money paid down for that lease, as it was clinched by a fine
in Feet of Fines, Hilary Term 1579 (230).</p>

<p>Though John had received the £40 from Lambert, plus
the fine from Webbe and Hooper, he was evidently still in
need, as we may learn from Roger Sadler’s will. Among
the debts due to him were “Item of Edmonde Lamberte
and —— Cornish for the debte of Mʳ John Shaksper £5”
(Prin. Prob. Reg. Som. House 1 Bakon. 17th January 1578-9).
We have had no information concerning the events of the
following two years. But it appears that John must have
committed some indiscretion about that time, which must
seriously have affected his fortunes. Many years ago I
had discovered a fine against his name in the Coram Rege
Rolls, but laid it aside until I had leisure to work up the
case. Not long since, with the help and advice of Mr.
Baildon, I spent some weeks investigating likely papers,
but found no further facts than those first gleaned, two
separate yet connected cases among the unnumbered pages
of the “fines” at the end of Coram Rege Roll, Trinity
22 Eliz. (a few pages from the end, half way down “Anglia”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
on the right). There we are told that John Shakespeare of
Stratford super Avon in Co. Warr., yeoman, because he had
not appeared before the Lady the Queen in her court at
Westminster, as summoned, to be bound over to keep the
peace, at a day now past, was due to pay £20, and that his
two sureties were to pay a fine of £10 each, for not having
produced him. His sureties were John Awdley of the town
of Nottingham, co. Notts, Hatmaker, and Thomas Colley
of Stoke in co. Stafford, yeoman. This becomes more
serious, because the next case is against John Awdelay
Hatmaker of the town of Nottingham co. Notts. Because
he did not appear before the Court of the Queen when
summoned at a day now past, bringing sufficient security,
to be bound over to keep the peace, he was to be fined
£40. And John Shakespeare of Stratford on Avon yeoman,
one of the two securities for John Awdelay, because
he had not brought him before the Queen on the day appointed,
was to pay £20, and Thomas Colley, another of
the securities, was also to be fined £20.</p>

<p>I looked through several terms before and after to see
if there were any suit in the Coram Rege Rolls on which
this may have been based, a difficult job, as I had no clue
to the name of a plaintiff or a county to guide me. The
only further reference was in the Exchequer accounts,
where, under “Anglia,” “Warr.,” “Villa Notts,” and “Staff.”
the same parties are entered for the same fines, Exchequer
K. R. accounts 109/13, m. 22. d. Fines and Amerciaments
Coram Regina Trinity Term 22 Eliz. Here, then, John
had another £40 to pay, evidently unexpectedly, in association
with two men who have not yet been connected
with his biography. Whether he did not appear as defendant,
or as witness in some case when summoned, or
whether he had committed some trespass, or had a free
fight with some one, as his brother Henry had with Edward
Cornwall in 1587, I have not been able to prove. In searching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
the Controlment Rolls, Mich. 22 Eliz., I had a surprise.
Among a number of names from various counties of persons
who “indicati sunt de eo qud Corpes felonici interfecere et
murderfare” was “John Shakespeare.” The very date. It
was a relief to see that he was “late of Balsall, co. Warr.”
I was allowed to get out some bundles of “ancient Indictments”
which had not been searched, and found in No. 650
that the said John Shakespeare, by the instigation of the
Devil, and his own malice, made a noose of rope fast to a
beam in his house and hanged himself on 23rd July 21 Eliz.
He had goods only to the value of £3 14<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> which John
Piers, the Bishop of Winchester, as chief almoner to the
Queen, granted by way of alms to the widow, Matilda
Shakespeare. (In the inventory of the goods are included
some painted cloths.)</p>

<p>Though John of Stratford’s fortunes were nothing so
tragic as those of John of Balsall, he was in a bad enough
way. His fine was money entirely <i>lost</i>, through some
folly; and he seems to have lost money otherwise. He
had to sell both the Snitterfield shares to Robert Webbe
outright, and he went down on Michaelmas 1580 to Barton-on-the-Heath
with the redemption money of Asbies in his
pocket. Edmund Lambert refused to receive it and release
the mortgage until John paid him also other debts he owed
him; but we know from later litigation that he had promised,
when these other debts were paid, to take the £40
and release the mortgage at any time. And again John
Shakespeare trusted his brother-in-law’s word.</p>

<p>The last implicit sign of the family possession of Asbies
is preserved in a little book among the State Papers, April
1580 (which none of the Baconians appear to have noted).
This is a list of “the Gentlemen and Freeholders of the
County of Warwick.” Among these appear John Shakespeare
of Stratford on Avon (the name spelt so) and
Thomas Shakespeare of Rowington. In another list the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
contracted form of the name is used. But the freehold was
slipping from him. He could not find sufficient money to
pay <i>everything</i> at once. There is no doubt that his son’s
impulsive marriage would increase his money difficulties.
So time passed on, and he was fighting from hand to
mouth, until on 1st March 1587 Edmund Lambert died, still
holding Asbies. Though John Lambert, the heir, seems to
have been offered the money, he refused it, and took possession.
He was not going to be bound by a mere verbal
promise of his father, even if it had ever been made. There
seem to have been family councils, friendly, logical, and
legal pressure applied. John Lambert refused to give up
the desirable family property. But a counter proposition
was made to him, and under pressure, to secure peace, he
seems to have agreed on 26th September 1587, at the
house of Anthony Ingram, gent., at Walford Parva, to pay
£20 extra by instalments, beginning on 18th November
1587, and again the Shakespeares trusted a Lambert’s
word.</p>

<p>Now it cannot be too carefully considered, that it was
the private discussions and decisions about the return of
Asbies, that were the deciding factors in John and William
Shakespeare’s life. Then they learnt that John Lambert
was determined not to give up Asbies; they knew they could
not go to Common Law, having for testimony only the
word of a dead man. And William Shakespeare, already
the father of three children, felt that he must make a career
somewhere, and determined on trying London. Why not?
Many of his friends had gone there and prospered. His
father would have the £40 he was ready to pay for Asbies.
He would have introductions enough, and he probably
reckoned on the £20 that John Lambert was to pay to
make up the sale-value of Asbies to a more just proportion
as likely to come to himself. We know that he suffered disillusionment;
we know that John Lambert did not pay that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
£20, denied even that he had promised it, and the next
step taken was the commencement of proceedings against
him for £20 at the Common Law. It is certain that, however
it might be entered in his parents’ name, William
Shakespeare, as the heir apparent, was associated formally
with it, probably instructed the attorneys, and did all the
personal duties of a “complainant.” And thus, by a
peculiar combination of circumstances, the first time
William Shakespeare’s name was written in London, the
first time it was spoken in London, <i>was in the Law-Courts</i>!<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
The case teaches us certain details, which have
not yet been made the most of, but it seemed to die out,
possibly from lack of funds among the complainants.
Lambert did not pay. And the fierce fight with fate which
Shakespeare made took place during the next few years.</p>

<p>“There’s a divinity that shapes our ends.” Fortune
turned in time. Shakespeare found work at the theatre,
seems to have been liberally treated, though at first servitor
or apprentice, and soon had a house in Bishopsgate Street,
on which he was assessed higher than either of the Burbages.
So it may reasonably be inferred he had his family by him
at least by 1594, for a time. He never forgot Asbies. So
when he did prosper he applied for arms for his father,
bought the best house in Stratford for his wife and got his
father and mother to have another fight for Asbies, this
time in a court in which he thought he had a better chance
of success. The Complaint on 24th November 1597 of John
Shackespeare and Mary his wife and Answer have been
printed among Special Proceedings in Chancery, Halliwell-Phillipps
has them, and also the Decrees and Orders, but
the details have not been worked out. Again John Shakespeare
committed an indiscretion. Either his attorney mistook,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
or John, thinking that William was putting himself in
power too much, had put forward a second complaint in <i>his
own name only</i>. Of course, Lambert complained of this,
and was supported. John had to withdraw one of his complaints
and pay the expenses of both parties in it, and
Lambert had permission to change his commissioners if
he pleased. In Decrees and Orders, 18th May 1598, John
Lambert’s Counsel said that John had exhibited a bill in
the name of himself and his wife, and then a bill in his own
name, had taken out his commission but examined no witnesses
(D. and O. A. 1598, Trin. 706). On 27th June they
had powers given to elect a commission to examine witnesses
by the octaves of Michaelmas, directed to Richard
Lane, John Combes, William Berry and John Warner.
On 6th July 1598 (B. Book, 133), a new commission was
appointed, and John Lambert changed his commissioners,
probably finding those chosen first too much in favour of
the Shakespeares. The new commission reads, Richard
Lane, John Combes, Thomas Underhill, and Francis
Woodward. The interesting part in such cases is the
examination of witnesses. But the depositions have not
been preserved; (I have sought for them very carefully both
in Stratford and P.R.O.). That they had been taken, and
had been in favour of the Shakespeares may be inferred
by the entry,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“John Shakespeere and Mary his wife:—Yf the defendant shew
no cause for stay of publication by this day sennight then publication
is granted” (23rd October, Mich. 41 &amp; 42 Eliz. D. and O.
B. 1599).</p>
</div>

<p>This is the last word concerning the case, and we are
left to surmise the sequel. Whether John Lambert, finding
himself about to be beaten, put as a bar the Coram Rege case,
and the Shakespeares’ offer to accept £20 in lieu of the
property, and acknowledged his willingness to pay it <i>now</i>;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
or whether the waning fortunes of the Essex party withdrew
what court influence might have come through the
poet, we know not. But we know that there was never
more a “Shakespeare of Asbies”; and that even on the
death of his father in 1601 (curiously enough at the very
time of the end of the twenty-one years lease he had drawn
up from 1580), William instituted no further proceedings
in his own name, and contented himself by purchasing
other lands and leases of tithes.</p>

<p>One point I should have noticed is, that the final concord
which Edward Lambert had drawn up in 1578, and had
enrolled in 1579, was endorsed with the records of <i>fifteen
proclamations</i>. The first could only have been at the Easter
Assizes 1581, at Warwick, after the forfeiture of Michaelmas
1580; it was repeated every year, until the Shakespeares
began to take proceedings in Chancery. It was stayed
while the case was running, and never resumed, for John
Lambert remained in possession at the now-vanished
Asbies.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IV">IV<br><span class="small">MARY ARDEN’S ARMS</span></h2></div>


<p>There has been much discussion concerning Shakespeare’s
descent from the Ardens of Park Hall, and,
through them, from the heroes of national legend. In some
of the objections brought forward against his assumed pedigree,
prejudice has been treated as proof, and opinion as
reasoning. The critical strictures are best summed up in
Nicholls’s “Herald and Genealogist,” 1863, vol. i, p. 510,
and in “Notes and Queries,” 3rd Series, vol. v, p. 493:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
(1) That the relationship is imaginary and impossible, and
those who assert it in error. (2) That the Ardens were
connected with nobility, while Robert Arden was styled
“husbandman.” (3) That the heralds knew the claim was
unfounded when they scratched out the arms of Arden of
Park Hall, and inserted the arms of Arden of Alvanley, in
Cheshire. Though this was equally unjustifiable, the family
being further off, there was less likelihood of complaint.</p>

<p>French, in his “Shakespeareana Genealogica,” p. 431 <i>et
seq.</i>, opposes these statements by others; and the interesting
reproduction of the drafts and patents of Shakespeare’s
arms, with the accompanying letterpress by Mr. Stephen
Tucker, Somerset Herald, puts a student in a position to
estimate them at their true worth. (See “Miscell. Geneal.
et Herald.,” 1886, Ser. II, vol. i, p. 109.) I would now bring
forward some arguments which may act as cumulative evidence
to determine wavering opinion on the question.</p>

<p>Dugdale’s table shows that Walter Arden married
Eleanor, daughter of John Hampden, of Hampden, in
co. Bucks, and had, besides his eldest son and heir Sir
John, esquire of the body to Henry VII, five sons, Martin,
Thomas, Robert, Henry, William; Martin being placed as
the second son, and Thomas as the third. But Thomas is
given as second son and Martin as third, in Harl. MS. 1167,
from which the visitation is published. (Compare Harl. 853,
ff. 113-114; 1110, f. 24b; 1563, f. 5, f. 39; Harl. 2011, ff. 64b,
65, f. 75.)</p>

<p>The will of Walter Arden in 1502 (31 July, 17 Hen. VII)
at Doctors’ Commons proves that at that date he had a
son Thomas, named second in order. “Thomas Arden and
John Charnells,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Squires,” attest the document. (See
French, p. 452.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>I will that my sonne Thomas have dureing his lief x marcs
whiche I have given to him. And that my sonne Martin have the
Maner of Natfield dureing his lief according as I thereof made
hym astate yf it canne be recorded, And yf not, thenne I will that
the same Martyn and every of my other sonnes, Robᵗ, Henry,

a sufficient astate of landes and tenements to the yearely value of

</div>

<p>This is an income too small for a younger brother to live
on, even in those days, and we must imagine that the
father had either placed them, married them well, or endowed
them in some way during his life. He could not be
expected to do much. His father Robert had spent his
substance in the Wars of the Roses, and was brought to
the block in 30 Hen. VI (1452). Park Hall would be forfeited
to the Crown and its acres impoverished. When
Walter Arden was restored by Edward IV he would probably
be encumbered by debt, and his large family (for there
were daughters also) further limited his powers. This may
help to account for the smallness of the legacies. Thomas,
being the second son, might have had something from his
mother or her kin. This same Thomas was alive in 1526,
for Sir John Arden then wills that his brothers “Thomas,
Martin, and Robert should have their fees during their
lives.” We may, therefore, suppose that Henry and William
had meanwhile died. It is probable that William had
gone to reside at Hawnes, in Bedfordshire, as one bearing
his name and arms appeared in that place about his
time.</p>

<p>Seeing that Sir John was esquire of the body to
Henry VII, it is very likely that his younger brother
Robert was the Robert Arden, yeoman of the chamber (indeed
Leland says he was so), to whom Henry VII granted
three patents; the first on 22nd February 17 Henry VII:
“In consideration of good and true services of our beloved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
servant Robert Arden, a yeoman of our chamber, we appoint
him Keeper of our Royal Park at Aldercar,” <i>i.e.</i>, Altcar, co.
Lanc., 17 Henry VII (second part, pat. m. 30). In the same
series, m. 35, 9th September 17 Henry VII, he was granted
the office of Bailiff of Codmore, co. Derby, and Keeper of
the Royal Park there. The third is 24th September 23
Henry VII (first part, pat. m. 12), a grant of Yoxall, for
life, or a lease of twenty-one years if it descended to heirs,
all royal rights reserved, at a rental of £42 a year. (See
Boswell-Malone’s “Shakespeare,” Appendix, vol. ii, 544,
545.)</p>

<p>It is not recorded that Martin received Natfield, and it
would not seem that he did so, as he lived at Euston, co.
Oxford (Harl. Visit.). He married Margery, daughter and
coheir of Henry East, of the Hayes, in co. Worcester;
and his daughter and heir Eleanor (elsewhere Elizabeth)
married first William Rugeley, of Shenston, co. Stafford,
and then Thomas Gibbons, of Ditchley, co. Oxford (Visit.
Ox. Harl. Public.).</p>

<p>Where meanwhile was Thomas Arden? Dugdale does
not mention him again. There is no record of any Thomas
Arden, either in Warwickshire or elsewhere, save the
Thomas who is found, the year before Walter Arden’s
death, living at Wilmcote, in the parish of Aston Cantlowe,
on soil formerly owned by the Beauchamps. On
16th May, 16 Henry VII, a deed was drawn up at Snitterfield,
commencing:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sciant presentes et futuri quod ego Johannes Mayowe de
Snytterfeld dedi, concessi et hac presenti carta mea confirmavi
Roberto Throkmerton Armigero, Thome Trussell de Billesley,
Rogero Reynolds de Henley-in-Arden, Willelmo Wodde de Wodhouse,
Thome Ardern de Wylmecote et Roberto Ardern filio
ejusdem Thomæ Ardern, unum mesuagium cum suis pertinenciis
in Snytterfield. (See Halliwell-Phillipps’s “Outlines,” vol. ii,
p. 207.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>The deed is in the miscellaneous documents of Stratford-on-Avon
(see Halliwell-Phillipps’s “Calendar of the Stratford
Records,” p. 291, vol. ii, No. 83).</p>

<p>This list of trustees is worth noting. Thomas Trussel is
identified by his residence being given. He became Sheriff
for the county in 23 Henry VII, and was of an old and
well-known family (see Harl. Visit. and Dugdale). No
Robert Throckmorton in the county could have precedence
of him, save Robert Throckmorton of Coughton, who six
months later, in November of the same year, was knighted,
“a noble and pious man,” says Dugdale. He made his will
in 1518, before he set out for the Holy Land. This was
proved in 1520. His son George succeeded him at Coughton.
Edward Arden, of Park Hall, was brought up in his
care, and married Mary, his son Robert’s daughter.</p>

<p>That a man of the same name, living at the same time,
in the same county, retaining the same family friends, under
circumstances suitable in every way to the second son of
Walter Arden’s will, should be accepted as that son, seems
perfectly natural and just, when <i>no other claimant has ever
been brought forward</i>. But we <i>know</i> that this Thomas and
this Robert were Mary Arden’s grandfather and father;
we <i>know</i> that this property was that afterwards left in
trust by this Robert Arden for his daughters; we <i>know</i>
that the Shakespeares claimed the relationship, and that
the heralds allowed it. Men should be judged truthful
until proved guilty of falsehood, and no proof has ever
been laid down against their statement. I bring forward
only as a faint sidelight<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> the fact that of Robert Arden’s
seven daughters at Wilmcote, the four younger, Margaret,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
Joyce, Alice, Mary, bore Arden names. The first and third,
Agnes and Katharine, had Throckmorton names; and Joane
was the name of Thomas Trussel’s unknown wife.</p>

<p>Mr. Nicholls’s second objection to this unbelieved-in
Thomas, that he could not be a son of the Ardens because
he is styled “husbandman,” is of little weight. The word
is an old English equivalent for “farmer,” and might be
applied to any gentleman resident on his lands. In this
sense it is often used in old wills; it is so used in Stratford-on-Avon
records, and in the examination of John Somerville,
who stated that he had received no visitors but
“certain husbandmen, near neighbours” (S.P.D.S. Eliz.,
1583). “The kingdom of heaven is like unto a husbondman
that went out first bi the morowe to hire werkmen
into his vineyard” (Matt. xx, 1, Wycliffe). Even Dryden,
in “Threnodia Augustalis,” says “The Royal Husbandman
appeared”; and Mr. French notes other uses of the word:
“The Arden Husbandman of Wilmecote in 1523 and 1546
paid the same amount to the subsidy as the Arden Esquire
of Yoxall, 1590” (French, “Shaks. Gen.,” p. 423). It is
more than probable that this Thomas married an unambitious
wife. There is even yet a chance of finding her
name through some will or deed.</p>

<p>Mr. Nicholls’s third assertion, that the heralds scratched
out the arms of Arden of Park Hall because they dare not
quarter them with those of the Shakespeares, requires to
be more fully dealt with.</p>

<p>Drummond, in his “Noble British Families,” exemplifies
many varieties of the arms of Arden, and traces them back
to their derivation. He notes that “none of the branches
or sons of the Earls of Warwick bore their arms, but only
the eldest son, who was earl”; and that “the elder branch
of the Ardens took the arms of the old Earls of Warwick,
the younger branches took the arms of Beauchamp with a
difference.” Now it is quite true that the Ardens of Park<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
Hall bore Ermine, a fesse chequy or and az., arms derived
from the Earls of Warwick, and that this was the pattern
scratched out in Shakespeare’s quartering. But no critic
seems to have noted the reason. Mary Arden was heiress
not in the eldest line, but <i>through a second son</i>. The true
pattern for a second son was three cross crosslets fitchée,
and a chief or. As such they were borne by the Ardens of
Alvanley, with a crescent for a difference. They were
borne without the crescent by Simon Arden<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> of Longcroft,
the second son of Thomas, son of Sir John, and full
cousin of Mary Arden’s father. It is true that among the
tombs at Yoxall the fesse chequy appears; but that branch
gained a right to this coat after the extinction of the elder
line in 1643.</p>

<p>Glover’s “Ordinary of Arms” mentions among the
“marks of cadency” a martlet. Martin Arden, of Euston,
co. Oxford, was clearly in the wrong to assume as he did
the arms of his elder brother. William Arden, of Hawnes,
in co. Bedford, correctly bore the three cross crosslets and
the martlet. The three cross crosslets fitchée were the
correct arms, and the martlet the correct difference, for
Thomas Arden, as the second son of an Arden who might
bear Ermine, a fesse chequy or and az. Thus Glover
enumerates (vol. ii, ed. 1780) among the arms of Warwickshire
and Bedfordshire: “Arden or Arderne. Gu., three
cross crosslets fitchée or; on a chief of the second, a
martlet of the first. Crest, a plume of feathers charged
with a martlet or.” It is strange that Mr. Nicholls omitted
to consider this. Camden and the other heralds of the
sixteenth century were only seeking correctness in the
restitution of arms, which were impaled in John Shakespeare’s
case on the right, as of the older and nobler
origin.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>
<p>A similar contention arose about Edmund Neville, Edward
Arden’s nephew (S.P.D.S. Eliz. 185, 72):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Pedigree of Neville and statement that he may bear Latimer’s
arms. Richard Lord Latimer’s eldest son was John, Lord Latimer;
his second son, William Neville of Latimer. John’s son John,
Lord Latimer, died without male issue, leaving four daughters, his
heirs, who divided his lands, and may quarter his arms. William
Neville’s son was Richard Neville, who married Barbara, sister of
Edward Arden of Park Hall, and their son is Edmund. By the
custom and usage of England, after the decease of John, Lord
Latimer, without issue male, Richard Neville, his cousin german,
may bear the arms of the family, <i>without distinction or difference</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>If heraldry, therefore, has anything to say to this dispute,
it is to support the claim of Thomas to being a cadet of
the family of the Park Hall Ardens.</p>

<p>Nothing is recorded to account for Shakespeare allowing
the arms of his mother, impaled on his father’s shield, to
lapse from his own. It may be that, on his father’s death
in 1601, he thought of the old meaning of quartering, “that
it may be known whom a man hath married”; it may be
that, tender of his Anne’s feelings, who had no arms to
quarter, he let his spear shine alone on his shield; or it
may be that, having proved his pedigree, he felt that</p>

<p>In writing his “Outlines of the Life of Shakespeare,”
Halliwell-Phillipps determined not to give the reins to
his imagination, and to accept nothing that he did not
think he could <i>prove</i>. At times, however, his treatment of
probabilities seems to suggest that he had made up his
mind that Shakespeare had grown up under conditions
which make it hard to understand the possibility of the
development of the <i>poet</i> in the <i>man</i>. Many of his statements
have been pressed into the service of the peculiar
people who deny Shakespeare to be a poet at all. One of
these, given as a fact, is that Stratford was a “bookless
neighbourhood.” It is always rash to use universal propositions
when they are not built up from a thorough examination
of all possible particulars, as it leaves them
liable to be proved untrue by a very limited opposite.
Very little would serve to prove Halliwell-Phillipps to be
mistaken in his statement, and, with him, all the crowd of
copyists who follow him in everything they please to select
from his work and opinion. This may be done both generally
and specially.</p>

<p>I. Generally.—We know that Becon, in dedicating “The
Jewel of Joy” to the Princess Elizabeth in 1549, speaks of
Warwickshire as the most intellectual of English counties.
We know that Stratford, as a town, was intelligent enough
to pay its schoolmaster far above the average. Indeed, the
master of Stratford Grammar School received a salary
<i>double</i> that of the master of Eton. It is therefore more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
than probable that Stratford had the best masters going
at the time. And good masters imply good books. From
several sources we know the curriculum of the grammar
schools of the day, and the classical books that were used.
A master who could teach from such books would be sure
to have, like Chaucer’s clerk,</p>

<p>The vicar of Stratford Church and the curate of the
chapel would most likely have a selection of volumes in
their possession; the attorneys would have their law books,
the doctors their medical books. We <i>know</i> from his
will as well as from John Hall’s “cures” that Shakespeare’s
son-in-law had a notable library, which people from a
distance, even, came to see. Richard Field, the Stratford
printer in London, had a very large and important list of
publications, some of which were sure to have found their
way down to his native town. Many Warwickshire men
were London printers. There is every reason to believe
that the first Sir Thomas Lucy had a library at Charlecote,
which had become enriched in his son’s time, and is remembered
in his will and on his tombstone. Sir Henry
Rainsford, in the neighbourhood, the friend and patron of
Drayton the poet, was little likely to be unprovided. Sir
Fulke Greville, the Recorder of Stratford, was a reading
man, and not only was a possessor, but also a creator, of
books. Clement Throgmorton of Haseley, was a learned
man; and his notable son Job was entangled in the Martin
Marprelate controversy. Every recusant’s arrest and trial
were based on his possessing “books” of a kind other than
the Government approved. One can in this way almost
indefinitely widen the sphere of the <i>general</i> existence of
books. But generalities have not the convincing power of
specialities, and as I have found, without much searching,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
the <i>names</i> of some of the books in Stratford and its immediate
neighbourhood, there may yet be found many
more existing to prove the rashness of Halliwell-Phillipps’s
assumption.</p>

<p>II.—Specially.—Among the legal cases brought before
the Town Council were some referring to special books.
For instance, in 1604 “Valentine Palmer was attached to
answer Philip Rogers, for unlawfully detaining a certain
book called ‘Gailes Kyrirgery,’ valued at ten shillings and
twopence.” This refers to “Certain Workes of Chirurgery,”
by Gale, published in 1563, and reprinted in 1586 (see
Miscellaneous Documents of Stratford-on-Avon, 2 James I,
No. 23). No. 149 of the same series gives “the answer of
Philip Rogers to Valentine Palmer about ‘Gailes Kyrirgery.’”
The one book in itself is important enough to overthrow
the sweeping assertion.</p>

<p>But in support of the natural opinion that the clergy
would have books, we have at least one will, one inventory,
and one list of prices of the books of a curate in the very
parish of Stratford—that of Bishopton. There may have
been more books, worn and valueless, but we are told the
names of those in good enough condition to have some
marketable price. The Rev. John Marshall, curate of
Bishopton, died, not young, in the fourth year of James I
(1607). He left by will to his kinsman Francis Jeccoxe
“Babington upon Genesis”; to Richard his son “Martin
Luther upon 1st and 2nd epistle of St. Peter”; to John
Jeccoxe, “my godsonne, my boke called ‘The Image of
God.’”</p>

<p>In the Inquisition of his goods taken 10th January 1606-7,
by Abraham Sturley, Ralfe Lorde, Francis Ainge, William
Ainge, and Thomas Cale, we find that some of these, or all
of them, knew enough about books to affix a contemporary
saleable value, which, though it seems small to us, must be
reckoned according to the money rates of the time. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
their inventory has not been printed, and as it gives a fair
illustration of the class of libraries owned by the minor
clergy, it seems worth giving <i>in extenso</i>. It will be seen
that it contains various irregularities and contractions:</p>

<p>This list—fairly long in classics, divinity, and law for a
country clergyman even of to-day—suggests that the
Rev. John Marshall was a teacher as well as a preacher.
It suggests also that he had long been a collector of books,
and that he did not altogether despise the study of lighter
literature. The duplicates suggest that he might be ready
to lend his books. The list may help the bibliographer in
regard to old editions. Vautrollier and Field had the
monopoly of Calvin’s works. This library certainly helps
the Shakespearean to realize the class of clergy among
whom the poet lived, and of itself redeems his birthplace
from the charge, so often brought against it, of being altogether
“a bookless neighbourhood.”</p>

<p>Curiously enough, shortly after this the Chamberlain
enters in his accounts, “For the carriage of books to
London, 1<i>s.</i>” The town council were always very careful to
have “a sufficient scholar from Oxford for the Usher’s
place.” It may be well to add that one of Shakespeare’s
sons-in-law was a great physician, the other a French
scholar, and that the latter’s brother, George Quiney,
usher and curate, was described as “of a good wit, expert
in tongues, and <i>very</i> learned.” His fellow usher, Mr. John
Trapp, afterwards head-master, “for his piety and learning
second to none,” by overmuch study brought on a fit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
of melancholy, and he was rescued “from the jaws of
death.” How could all these, and more, study without
<i>books</i>?</p>

<p>The universal belief in the booklessness of Stratford-on-Avon
in general, and the poet’s family in particular,
makes it the more important to record any facts
which tend to weaken that belief. A case came up more
than once before the burgh court concerning some property
claimed by two women as inheritance from their grandmother.
“The names of the jurors in the cause of Margaret
Younge <i>v.</i> Jone Perat, 20th July, 37 Elizabeth,” are given
in the Miscellaneous Documents, Stratford-on-Avon, VII,
245 and 246, Apparently Jone Perat had already disposed
of some of the property she held, which chiefly seemed to
consist of articles of women’s clothing. But there were
other articles also, and there were at least four books. At
the foot of the statement is the note:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mʳ Shaxpere, one book; Mʳ Barber, a coverlett, two daggers,
the three bokes; Ursula Fylld, the apparell and the bedding
clothes at Whitsontyde was twellmonth. Backe debts due to the
partie defendant.</p>
</div>

<p>It is to be supposed that at this date it must have been
John, and not William, who was designated “Mr. Shaxpere.”
Imagination is left to play vainly round the nature
of the book; but it is clear from these rough notes that he
had coveted one special book in Jone Perat’s possession,
that he had secured it, but that he had not yet paid for it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
Mr. Barber also, it may be noted, held three books on the
same doubtful tenure, between plaintiff and defendant.
But at least four books were in the market in Stratford at
that date which had been in the possession of the old
grandmother.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VII">VII<br><span class="small">JOHN SHAKESPEARE, OF INGON, AND
GILBERT, OF ST. BRIDGETS</span></h2></div>


<p>When a long chain of arguments depend upon one
fact, and that fact is disproved, the dependent arguments
become invalid. It would be invidious to correct
formally two trifling errors in Halliwell-Phillipps’s monumental
work, if it had not happened that they were the
support of other errors.</p>

<p>1. He states authoritatively in his “Outlines” (ii, 253)
that the John Shakespeare of Ingon could not be the John
of Henley Street, because the former was buried in 1589,
and the latter in 1601. “Joannes Shakespeare of Yngon
was buried the xxvth of September, 1589,” in the parish of
Hampton-Lucy. Yet a careful consideration of the register
shows that the entry was not “Joannes,” but “Jeames.”
This Mr. Richard Savage is clear about. The “Jeames”
may have been some elder untraced connection, but it is
much more than likely he was the “Jeames, son of Henry
Shakespeare, of Ingon,” whose baptism is recorded in the
same register, 1585, as there is no further entry concerning
this cousin of the poet’s. This error being cleared away,
there is no fundamental objection to the opinion that John<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
Shakespeare of Henley Street might be the same as John
of Ingon, mentioned in the measurement of a neighbouring
farm, 23 Elizabeth, “Ingon ... then or late in the tenure
of John Shaxpere or his assignes.” The relation John
held to his brother Henry makes it very likely indeed that
Ingon was in his nominal tenure, and that Henry farmed
it as his “assigne.”</p>

<p>If John of Henley Street may be considered the same as
John of Ingon, he must also be considered the same as the
John, Agricola, of Snitterfield, who, in conjunction with
Nicols, was granted administration of his father Richard’s
goods in 1561, under a bond for £100. Some have considered
this uncertain, but they cannot have gone to
authorities. The administration in Worcester Probate
Registry, 10th February 1560-1, definitely states John of
Snitterfield was the son of Richard. He had probably
been born in Snitterfield, had some interest in the land
there, was probably resident there at the time of his father’s
illness and death, to look after affairs, and very probably
described himself at the Registrar’s Office as having
come direct from Snitterfield to wind up the affairs of his
father’s farm, complicated by the lease granted by Mrs.
Arden, to her brother Alexander Webbe. Though it might
not be absolutely certain that John of Snitterfield was
John of Stratford, it seems settled in 1581, when the
Mayowes contested the claims of the Ardens, and Adam
Palmer, the surviving feoffee, and John and Henry Shakespeare,
his brother, were summoned as witnesses for the
Ardens before the Commission appointed at Stratford.</p>

<p>2. The second is a more important error, for it seems to
substantiate a hazy tradition that Shakespeare’s brother
lived to a great age, and retailed to greedy ears gossip
concerning the poet’s acting. Halliwell-Phillipps, “Outlines,”
i, 35, states that “Gilbert entered into business in
London as a Haberdasher, returning in the early part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
the following century to his native town.” Among the
notes there is given an indefinite entry to support this,
without the term, the case, or the names of the parties
being given (ii, 289): “In the Coram Rege Rolls, 1597,
Gilbert Shackspere, who appears as one of the bail in the
amount of £19 for a clockmaker of Stratford, is described
as a Haberdasher of the Parish of St. Bridget.” He further
considers the Stratford burial of 1612 to have been that of
Gilbert’s son.</p>

<p>I had always thought it extremely improbable that at
the time of John Shakespeare’s financial difficulties in
Stratford-on-Avon he would have found himself able to
place his second son as an apprentice in London to any
member of that wealthy company. But lately I determined
to test the truth of the statement. Through the courtesy
of the Worshipful Company of Haberdashers I was allowed
to go through their books at leisure. I found that not only
was there an entire absence of the name of Shakespeare
from the list of apprentices or freemen, but that during the
whole of the sixteenth century there was only one “Gilbert,”
and he was “Gilbert Shepheard,” who took up his freedom
in 1579, when the poet’s brother would be thirteen years of
age.</p>

<p>Through the kindness of the Vicar of St. Bridgets, or
St. Brides, I was also allowed promptly to go through the
registers, which commence only in 1587—early enough,
however, for Gilbert Shakespeare. But there is no mention
of the name, either among marriages, births, or deaths. Of
course, this does not prove that he did not reside in the
parish.</p>

<p>The subsidy rolls are also silent as to his residence
there. But in both places occur the name of Gilbert
Shepheard, Haberdasher. The discovery of Halliwell-Phillipps’s
want of thoroughness in regard to this statement
discouraged me in attempting to wade through the six<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
volumes of closely-written contracted Latin cases that
make up the Coram Rege Roll of 1597. I felt nearly certain
that I would only find Gilbert Shepheard there also.
For I have been driven to the conclusion that Halliwell-Phillipps
misread “Shepheard” as “Shakespeare.” It sends
us, therefore, back to the more likely neighbourhood of
Stratford-on-Avon for further reference to the poet’s
brother. He was known to be there in 1602, taking seisin
of land in his brother’s name. The burial entry of 1611-12
is peculiarly worded, I confess, and gives some reason to
suppose that he had a son born elsewhere, here buried as
“Gilbertus Shakespeare, Adolescens.” But when we remember
there is no other record of marriage or of birth, no
other entry of a Gilbert’s death save this, it makes us reconsider
the situation. We know that the poet’s brother
Edmund died in 1607 in Southwark, and his brother
Richard in 1612-13 in Stratford-on-Avon. In the poet’s
will, written about four years later, there is no allusion to
a brother or any of his connections or descendants. This
brother would certainly have been mentioned in some of
the wills of the Shakespeares had he been alive. We are
aware that parish clerks were not always perfectly correct,
and that, at the time, there was a general tendency to use
pompous words, of which the meaning was not fully understood.
Shakespeare’s plays show this. Dogberry would
have borne out the clerk of Stratford-on-Avon in any
rendering he chose to give. He would have been no worse
than a Mrs. Malaprop if he intended “adolescens” to represent
“deeply regretted,” and in the absence of further
proof this need not be accepted as clear evidence that
Gilbert Shakespeare lived to a great age. (See Note VII.)</p>

<p>We know little of any of the poet’s relatives, but from
what we do know, none of them touches our imagination
so keenly as does his uncle Henry Shakespeare of
Snitterfield. We can read between the lines of the bald
notices preserved, and picture him warm-hearted, hot-headed,
high-spirited, imprudent rather than improvident,
unlucky himself, and bringing bad luck to all connected
with him. I have discovered some papers which show that
misfortunes pursued him even to the bitter end.</p>

<p>He was probably born in the house his father Richard
rented from Robert Arden, which abutted on the High
Street of Snitterfield, and seems to have been the youngest
son. It was John who “administered” his father’s goods;
it was more likely John who found the farm in Ingon,
whither Henry had to remove when Agnes Arden leased
the Snitterfield property to her brother Alexander Webbe.
There Henry dwelt from 1561 till 1596, seemingly industrious,
but rarely able, even with his brother’s help, to
make two ends meet.</p>

<p>Alexander Webbe made his will 15th April 1573, to
which Henry Shakespeare was one of the witnesses, and
John, being brother-in-law, was an overseer.</p>

<p>On 12th October 1574, Henry Shakespeare had a free
fight with Edward Cornwell. Both were fined, the latter 2<i>s.</i>,
Henry 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, because “he drew blood to the injury of
Edward Cornwell, and against the peace of the Queen.” It
must not be forgotten that this Edward Cornwell stepped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
into Webbe’s shoes by marrying his widow Margaret (<i>née</i>
Arden). It may therefore have been some matter of jealousy,
or some exasperating airs of superiority, which made
Henry Shakespeare take the law into his own hands, and
give Cornwell a good drubbing. Yet “Hary Shaxsper”
was among the witnesses subpœnaed by the Commission
appointed to hear the appeal of Thomas Mayowe against
Edward Cornwell and the Ardens in 1580.</p>

<p>He had serious trouble in a tithe case about that time,
in which the proceedings show the farm was of considerable
size. He refused to pay, because he said he had compounded;
he was summoned before the Ecclesiastical
Court,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> refused to submit to the decision, was pronounced
contumacious, and was finally excommunicated, 5th November
1581.</p>

<p>In 1583 he was fined for refusing to wear cloth caps on
Sunday, as by statute was ordained for men of his degree;
and he was often fined for default of suit of Court.</p>

<p>Lettyce, daughter of Henry Shakespeare of Ingon, was
baptized 4th June 1583; and “Jeames, son of Henry Shakespeare
of Ingon, was baptized October 15th, 1585.” See
Register of Bishop Hampton.</p>

<p>On 4th September 1586 Henry stood godfather to Henry
Townsend in Snitterfield along with William Maydes and
Elizabeth Perkes.</p>

<p>On 2nd November of that year, when Christopher Smith,
<i>alias</i> Court, of Stratford-on-Avon, yeoman, drew up his
will, he entered among his assets “Henry Shaxspere of
Snitterfield oweth me 5<i>l.</i> 9<i>s.</i>”</p>

<p>Other debts Henry was unable to pay—one especially
to Nicholas Lane, for which his brother John had become
security. Nicholas Lane sued John Shakespeare to recover
in the Court of Records on 1st February 29 Eliz., 1586-7,
for the debt of “Henricus Shakesper frater dicti Johannis”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
(a statement clear enough to silence the quibblers who
assert there is no proof of relationship between the men).
Doubtless this was a crushing blow to John amid his own
troubles.</p>

<p>In 1591 Henry Shakespeare was arrested for debt by
Richard Ainge, and, seeming to have found no bail, remained
in prison some time.</p>

<p>The last recorded incident in his life is of the same
nature. John Tomlyns had him attached for debt on
29th September 1596. Henry Wilson bailed him (see Misc.
Doc. vii, 225; also Court of Records, 3 papers), 13th October
1596, continuation of the action of John Tomlyns against
Henry Shaxspere; and on 27th October 1596, John Tomlyns
pled against Henry Shaxspere in a plea of debt. This
entry has been scratched out. He had lost his children,
worldly success had eluded him, and the broken-spirited
man sickened and died.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> He was buried at Snitterfield on
29th December 1596.</p>

<p>My new papers come to darken the circumstances into
tragic intensity (Uncal. Court of Requests, Elizabeth,
B. III). There are two complaints, both by John Blythe
of Allesley, co. Warwick, against William Meades, who, it
may be remembered, stood sponsor with Henry Shakespeare
for John Townsend’s child. The first complaint,
presented 30th June 40 Eliz., 1598, narrates that about three
years previously John Blythe had become, along with
William Meades of Coleshall, surety for a debt of John
Cowper of Coleshall to an unnamed creditor. Cowper did
not pay, neither did Meades, and the creditor recovered
from John Blythe alone, and he appealed for protection.
This complaint is scratched out, though it is pinned together
with the other papers.</p>

<p>The second complaint is to the effect that, about three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
years before, John Blythe of Allesley had sold and “delivered
to Henry <i>Shakespeare</i> of Snitfield,” two oxen for
the sum of £6 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, and the purchaser became bound in
a bill obligatory to pay at a date specified, now past, and
had not paid. The reason was that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Shakespeare falling extremely sicke, about such time as the
money was due, died about the time whereon the money ought to
have been paid, having it provided in his house against the day
of payment.... Now, soe it is ... that Shakespeare living
alone, without any companie in his house, and dying without either
friends or neighbours with him or about him, one William Meades,
dwelling near unto him, having understanding of his death,
presently entered into the house of the said Shakespeare after
that he was dead, and, pretending that the said Shakespeare was
indebted to him, ransacked his house, broke open his coffers, and
took away divers sums of money and other things;</p>
</div>

<p class="p0">went into the stable, and led away a mare;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>carried away the corn and hay out of the barn, amounting to a
great value, being all the proper goods and chattells of the said
Shakespeare while he lived; and not contented therewith, in the
night time, no one being present but his servants and such as he
sent for that purpose, he caused to be conveyed away all the
goods and household stuff belonging to the said Shakespeare,
which money and goods were of a great value ... and converted
them to his own proper use.</p>
</div>


<p>John Blythe cannot speak with certainty upon the subject,
as no witnesses were present but those brought by
Meades, and it was worked in secret, so that he cannot
proceed by the course of the Common Law. He had
frequently asked Meades to pay the £6 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> due to him
for Henry Shakespeare’s oxen, from the goods he had
taken. Blythe did not think it fair that Meades should
satisfy himself without considering the other creditors, and
thought that if there was not enough to pay all, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
should share in proportion, and prayed that William
Meades be summoned before the Court to make personal
answer.</p>

<p>A Privy Seal for a Commission to inquire into the truth
was granted, dated 30th October 40 Eliz., 1598, on which is
written “The execution in another schedule attached” (now
lost).</p>

<p>The answer of William Meades, dated 13th January 41
Eliz., 1598-9, lightens the horror a little. He does not
acknowledge anything in Blythe’s complaint to be true,
but is willing to declare all he knows. Henry Shakespeare,
late of Snitterfield, having a wife living in the house with
him named Margaret, died at Snitterfield about two years
ago. He, William Meades, understanding of his death,
went to the house about two hours after his decease, being
accompanied by Thomas Baxter, Christopher Horn, Richard
Taylor, and others, neighbours, hoping that Shakespeare
had taken order with his wife to satisfy him of the sum
of £4 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, due by Shakespeare to him, William Meades.
But the said Margaret said there was no order taken
by her late husband for the payment of any debt to
him or any other creditor, and he departed quietly, without
any ransacking of the house or taking away any money
or goods which were Henry Shakespeare’s while he lived,
as most untruly and slanderously hath been alleged against
him. But he hath been credibly informed, and verily believeth,
that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>one William Rownde of Allesley, co. Warr., husbandman, standing
bound to John Blythe jointly with Henry Shakespeare in the
said sum of 6<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for the said oxen, and understanding that
Henry Shakespeare was under arest at Stratford-upon-Avon, and
there detayned in pryson for debt, and fearing lest he, the said
William Rownde, should be compelled to paie the sum of 6<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>
to the said John Blythe for the debt of Henry Shakespeare, he,
the said Rownde, did fetch the said two oxen from the said Henry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
Shakespeare and delivered them to the said John Blythe of Allesley
in discharge of the same debt.</p>
</div>

<p>Meades denied that he had gone in the night time and
taken away Henry Shakespeare’s goods, that he had
detained anything to his own use, or that John Blythe
had asked him to pay the £6 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> as surety. This is
signed by Bartholomew Hales, William Jeffreys, William
Cookes, and Ambrose Cowper, the Commissioners, the first
being lord of the manor.</p>

<p>The replication of John Blythe to William Meades,
23rd June 41 Eliz., 1599, upholds his former complaint,
which he is willing to prove. But the name of Henry
Shakespeare does not appear in it. There is no trace of
further action, or of any decision. But we have the tragic
picture of Henry Shakespeare’s haunted death-bed. John
Shakespeare, only four miles off, must have felt inclined,
when he heard of it, to say what Macduff did: “And I
must be from hence!”</p>

<p>Even more touching is the picture of the widow of two
hours being worried about her husband’s debts. Bereaved
and childless, she was left alone in the dismantled house,
where the wheels of life stood still, for a short time (only
six weeks), and then in Snitterfield “Margaret Sakspere,
being tymes the wyff of Henry Sakspere, was buried,
ix Feb., 1596/7.”</p>

<p>It is well known that William Shakespeare, his family,
and his friends were frequently connected with lawsuits
in Stratford-on-Avon; but it has not yet been noted that
his mother also appeared, in one case at least, under conditions
not quite clear.</p>

<p>Among the Miscellaneous Documents, Stratford-on-Avon,
Vol. VI, is a narrow strip of paper numbered 168.
It begins:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Jurie between Robert Reed, plaintiff, and John Sadler, defendant,
in a pley of trespas committed.</p>

<p>List of Jury: Phyllyp Grene; Ralph Lourd; Valentyne Taunt,
Jur.; Robert Byddell, Jur.; Rychard Dyxson; William Wyat,
Jur.; Rychard Boyse; Hough Piggon, Jur.; Edmund Watt;
Rychard Taylor, Jur.; Nycholas James, Jur.; George Perey;
Thomas Sharpe, Jur.; Humphrey Wheeler; Thomas Brydges;
Jullyan Shawe, Jur.; Robert Wylson; John Knyght; William
Tetherton; Rychard Pinck; George Mase, Jur.; Wylliam Slater,
Jur.; George Rose, Jur.; Thomas More, Jur.</p>
</div>

<p>This seems to be the case described in the same volume
of Miscellaneous Documents, VI, No. 176. Robert Reade
was a surgeon. John Gibbes was dangerously wounded
10th June 37 Eliz. John Sadler, his intimate friend and
neighbour, summoned Robert Reade, and promised him
£10 if he should cure Gibbes. This sum Sadler refused to
pay after the cure had been effected.</p>

<p>At the foot of the page, apparently unconnected with
the above, is another entry:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Capiat Rychard Jumpe at the suit of Johne Coocke in assumpsione
for cecurytie for iiiˡⁱ viˢ viiiᵈ to paye at Stratford fayre next.</p>
</div>

<p>Endorsed upside down, and hence on the back of the
later entry, appears</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Maria Shaxspere, Jur.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Jone Reade.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Jane Baker, Jur.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now can it be taken that these women were also on the
jury, or were they only sworn witnesses? One of these they
must have been. Of the three women’s names, one was
apparently ruled out, Jone Reade, probably related to
Robert Reed, plaintiff. The case is undated, and one
gathers no clues from the calendar. I have looked up the
dates of all the names mentioned in the Stratford Registers,
and find that it cannot have been heard later than 1597, as
Robert Bydell was buried 28th December 1597. Of the
others, Thomas Sharpe was buried 18th August 1608, and
“Marye Shaxspere, Wydowe,” on 9th September: “Jane,
daughter of Richard Baker, Shoemaker, 23rd Sept., 1613,”
though the entry might really refer to Jone, wife of Daniel
Baker, who was buried 16th May 1600.</p>

<p>It seems almost certain that this Maria was the wife of
John Shakespeare and the mother of William. There is
not another of the name in the Stratford Register; and
had she been one of the Rowington Shakespeares, her
place of residence would naturally have been mentioned as
a distinction. It is therefore possible that the poet learnt
some of his knowledge of law terms even from the experience
of his mother.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="X">X<br><span class="small">“HONORIFICABILITUDINITATIBUS” IN
WARWICKSHIRE<br>PILLERTON REGISTERS</span></h2></div>


<p>Through the kindness of the Rev. Neville Hill I
have been allowed to see the Pillerton Hersey registers,
which date from 1539. They have not been very
badly preserved, that is, they are not mouldy nor worm-eaten,
nor much frayed. But the earliest volume, at least,
is the most carelessly <i>kept</i> that I have ever seen, in the
sense of having entries (now undecipherable) scribbled all
over the covers, outside and inside; in having long gaps
without any records; and in having those of later date
wedged into spaces among the earlier ones, so that, for instance,
eighteenth-century entries in some places immediately
follow those of 1579.</p>

<p>On the inner sides of the covers are various scribblings
that can only be roughly dated by the study of the handwriting.
A superficial set of marks shows the scribbles of
a child. Yet the first scribe left his work exceptionally
well done. He was evidently proud of his beautiful penmanship,
and took great care in producing his records,
especially in his earlier years. What relation he bore to
the parish is uncertain. Dugdale says that the sixteenth-century
incumbents were “Ric. Moore, Cler., Nov. 11th,
1562; and v.p.m. Ric. Moore,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Rob. Hall,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Feb. 23rd, 1590.”
Of the first I can find no further record; of the second we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
may premise that he was the Robert Hale who matriculated
1580, 28th April, Glouc. pleb. f., 17 Broadgates H.
(see Boase, Reg. Univ. Oxford, vol. II, ii).</p>

<p>But the person who wrote the earlier pages leaves us in
no doubt as to his name being William Palmer. I can find
no reference to him in Boase, unless he appears in the list
of students: “Mr. William Palmer, 1565, Christ Church,
Student.” There were many Palmers in the neighbourhood,
some even in the parish. He may have been an
incumbent between the two known vicars; he may have
been a scribe employed to do the work; he may have
been a gentleman doing it for pleasure. But the work he
did was to transcribe the earlier paper registers into parchment,
as required by Act of Parliament. He did it well
and clearly, on several occasions stating that there had
been no entries during a certain number of years, or that
they had been put out of chronological order. It is not
quite clear when he reached contemporary dates; but the
last trace of his handwriting is in 1598, when a sprawling
script commences, and “Ro: Hale” signs the pages for a
long period, down, at least, till 1653. When William
Palmer commenced the little volume (about folio size from
top to bottom, little more than half in breadth) he wrote
in the inside of the upper cover two lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Hac jacet in Tumba Rosamundi non Rosamunda</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Non redolet, sed olet, quæ redolere solet.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A translation is given below by a later writer, but Palmer
in a more careless hand (yet evidently his own) states
further</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">An easie good brings easie gaines,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But thinges of price are bought with paines.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Apparently to try his pen and his handwriting on parchment,
he turned to the last page, laid the volume at right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
angles, and wrote, in his best and earliest style, near the
margin, “Honorificabilitudinitatibus, Constantinopolis.”</p>

<p>This fact might hardly have been thought worth recording,
but that some peculiar people, who base arguments
upon half-truths, have founded an oft-repeated argument
on the assertion that the only known use in literature of
this long word is in “Love’s Labour’s Lost” and “The
Northumberland Manuscript.” The fact has already been
recorded in “Notes and Queries” (9 S. ix, 494) that the first
known use in this country was in “The Complaint of
Scotland,” published in St. Andrews, 1548-9, where the
author (Sir John Inglis or Robert Wedderburn) classes it
among the “<i>long-tailed</i> words” which had been used in
other books. It is shown that Nash used it in his “Lenten
Stuff” in 1599, but this might have been quoted from
“Love’s Labour’s Lost,” and there are many later examples
(“Notes and Queries,” 9 S. ix, 371).</p>

<p>Here, however, is a case of its use in Warwickshire,
under exactly the same conditions as those of the Northumberland
MS. at a date earlier than that on which it had
been scribbled there, and in a locality where the book and
the writer were quite accessible to Shakespeare.</p>

<p>At the top of the same page on which the long-tailed
word was inscribed, there is recorded</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Collected at Pillerton Hersey towards the reliefe of Marlborough
the some of eight shillinges and two pence, Aug. the 24th, 1653.

<p>In another handwriting below this is written:</p>

written below this:</p>

<p>In a somewhat similar hand, at the foot of this page,
written in prose order, and with few capitals, run the
lines</p>

Priors towards the relief of Marlborough the somme of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
eight shillings and seven pence. Ro: Hale Minister 1653,”
a curious parallel to the entry in Pillerton Hersey, and
further witness to the long incumbency of Robert Hale.
At the end is the inventory of the church goods. I thought
the free use of names generally denoting the other sex was
worth recording, as well as the few entries of well-known
families.</p>

<p>I went to Nether Ettington to seek the tomb of Edward
Underhill. This property has belonged to the Shirleys for
a thousand years; but it was let to the Underhills for a
long lease of ninety-nine years, and many of their tombs
remain there still, among which is the reproduction of the
tablet to the memory of Anthony Underhill with the
notable verses. I could not find the tomb of this special
Edward carried from Pillerton. But there is one “to the
memory of Thomas Underhill of this town, Esq., and
Elizabeth his wife, who lived married together in perfect
amity above 65 years, ... and died in 1603.” As they had
thirteen sons and seven daughters, it is not remarkable
that their family should have spread to many neighbouring
parishes.</p>

ENCLOSURES<br>A NEW DETAIL IN HIS LIFE</span></h2></div>



<p>Among the many direct references to Shakespeare
contained in the records of Stratford-on-Avon, perhaps
none has been discussed more frequently than his relation
to the enclosures which his high-handed neighbour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
William Combe wished to make at Welcombe. But the
discussion has not always led to a study of all the papers
concerning it. Those who try to belittle Shakespeare assert
that he secured himself from loss by making conditions
with Mainwaring and Replingham (who were acting for
Combe), and then let the poor of Stratford bear the loss of
their ancient common as they might. But there are a great
many facts to be known concerning these enclosures which
are not reckoned with by the general readers of Shakespeare’s
so-called “Lives.” A few of these must now be
noted to lead up to the point I wish to record.</p>

<p>On 7th September, 1544, Anthony Barker, steward of the
dissolved College of Stratford-on-Avon, granted to William
Barker, gent., certain messuages, lands, and tithes of Stratford,
hitherto belonging to the College, for a period of
ninety-two years. This may or may not have been legal,
but the transfer has never been questioned. In time this
grant was inherited by John Barker, who in 22 Eliz. sold
the bulk of his estate to Sir John Huband, reserving to
himself a yearly rent of £27 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, with the condition
that if any part of that rent were left unpaid for forty days,
he could enter and retake possession of all until the end of
his term.</p>

<p>The charter granted by Edward VI to the Corporation
of Stratford-on-Avon settled on it the tithes for the support
of the refounded school and almshouses, and I have
not at present time to discuss the complex relations between
the town and Barker’s lease. Dr. Ingleby is entirely
wrong in his account of the tithes, which were not owned
only by Shakespeare and Greene. They were sold by Sir
John Huband in 1605, either directly or indirectly, to a
large number of holders, among whom was Shakespeare,
who was said to hold a “moietie”; but this by no means
represented a half, as we might be inclined to read it, even
of the tithes, and the “property” consisted, beyond the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
tithes, of houses, cottages, and fields. It may help the consideration
of the question to note the chief holders.</p>

<p>Richard Lane had a proportion worth £80 a year in the
tithes of Old Stratford; Shakespeare’s share was worth £60
a year; Thomas Greene’s, £3, and 20 marks in the tithes
of Drayton; Sir Edward Greville’s, 40<i>s.</i>; Sir Edward Conway’s,
£30; Mary Combe, widow, an estate for six years to
come, worth £10; John Lane, £8; Anthony Nash and
William Combe, £5; Daniel Baker, £20; John Smith, £8;
Francis Smith, £12; William Walford, 40<i>s.</i>; William
Court, £3; John Brown, £4; Thomas Jakeman, £10;
Richard Kempson and Stephen Burman, £15; Thomas
Burman, £3; “Thomas Horneby, an estate of the messuage
in which he now dwelleth, of the yearely value of £3”; and
eighteen others had similar shares, most of the smaller
holdings being in land or houses, and the larger in tithes.</p>

<p>Shortly after the poet’s purchase, he discovered that,
though he was careful to pay his share of Barker’s reserved
rent of £27 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> to Henry Barker, then lessee, many of
the other tenants were not paying theirs, and he ran the
risk of losing his property through the fault of others. So
he co-operated with Richard Lane and his lawyer cousin
Thomas Greene to file a complaint in Chancery against
those other tenants who did not pay their due share of the
reserved rent. The complainants acknowledged that some
of the tenants were willing to pay, but refused for fear of
the others; some made light of the claim; and the complainants,
for the preservation of their estates from forfeiture,
have had much loss and trouble. They prayed that
subpœnas be sent to the chief defaulters to appear and
make answer. The case was entered as “Lane, Greene,
Shakespeare, and others, con. W. Combe and others.” See
Misc. Doc., ii, 2. The suit appears to have been successful,
or at least some settlement was come to, for the possession
of the tithes was not lost by Shakespeare or his family.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
(Their shares were sold later by Dr. Hall.)<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> That is the
story of the tithes.</p>

<p>The enclosures began in 1614, about the time of “the
Great Fire.” There died in July that year John Combe the
moneylender, who had bought the old College in 1596, and
he left much of his property between his nephews William
and Thomas Combe. William apparently went to live at the
College, and shortly after took it into his head to enclose,
not “the Common,” but the “Common Fields” of Welcombe,
<i>i.e.</i>, arable land, liable to tithes. His agents inquired
who were likely to be most concerned. Probably for them
Thomas Greene had drawn up the list of “Auncient freeholders
in Old Stratford and Welcombe.” The poet heads
the list:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mr. Shakspeare, 4 yard land, noe common nor ground beyond
Gospel Bush, noe ground in Sandfield, nor none in Slow Hillfield
beyond Bishopton, nor none in the enclosure beyond
Bishopton. Sept. 5th, 1614.</p>
</div>

<p>William Combe was well aware of the purchase made by
Shakespeare, from his uncle and himself, of 107 acres of
arable land and 20 acres of pasture, not long before, recorded
in the Feet of Fines, P.R.O. It would only be
through the tithes that Shakespeare might suffer, so he sent
to him Mr. Mainwaring, steward of Lord Chancellor Ellesmere,
and Mr. Replingham, who seem to have been acting
both for Ellesmere and Combe, to guarantee that no one
should lose by the enclosures, as he was willing to make up
all losses, and was willing to make a deed in that respect,
to protect Shakespeare and his heirs. The poet seems to
have allowed them to do this, and one touch of his personal
affection for Thomas Greene incidentally appears in his insisting
that the security should include his cousin Greene.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
These “articles” were drawn up between William Shakespeare
and William Replingham on 28 October 1614. It is
one thing to allow any one to make an agreement that he
should not lose by an arrangement if it should be settled,
and quite another thing to approve of it, or to help it
forward.</p>

<p>Thomas Greene, feeling that the question was now becoming
important, commenced a series of “Mems. about
the Inclosure,” still preserved at Stratford-on-Avon, which
throw light on Shakespeare’s position. He took it easily,
because he did not think anything would be done. Greene
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Jovis 17 Nov. [1614.] My cosen Shakspeare commyng yesterday
to towne, I went to see him howe he did; he told me that
they assured him they ment to enclose noe further then to
gospell bushe, and so upp straight (leavyng out part of the dyngles
to the field) to the gate in Clopton Hedge and take in Salisbury’s
peece; and that they meane in Aprill to servey the Land, and
then to gyve satisfaction and not before, and he and Mr. Hall
say they think there will be nothyng done at all.</p>
</div>

<p>This is one of the very rare examples of Shakespeare’s
conversation having been preserved, even indirectly.</p>

<p>The next entry is also interesting. Greene, the Town
Clerk, records:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>23rd Dec., 1614. A Hall. Letters wrytten, one to Mr. Manneryng,
another to Mr. Shakspeare, with almost all the Companyes
hands to either: I alsoe wrytte of myself to my Cosen Shakespeare
the coppyes of all our oathes made then, also a note of the inconveniences
wold grow by the Inclosure.</p>
</div>

<p>Both of the letters to Shakespeare have disappeared; that
to Mainwaring has been preserved.</p>

<p>For the corporation did not take the proposal easily.
Even in the present they would lose, and in the future,
when Barker’s lease fell in, they would lose very much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
more, for the composition made with the leaseholders was
personal, and would not descend to them. In the midst of
the heavy losses caused by the recent fires, the danger assumed
large proportions in the eyes of those who had sworn
to do their best in trust for the town. They resisted it determinedly,
and were finally successful. Thomas Greene,
their clerk, proved a faithful and energetic official, yet he
too was tempted. He did not seem to have been told at the
time, but he records in his Diary:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>9 Ja: [1614.] Mr. Replyngham 28th October, articled with
Mr. Shakspeare, and then I was put in by T. Lucas,</p>
</div>

<p class="p0">who drew up the articles.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On Wednesday, being the 11th day [January.] At night
Mr. Replingham supped with me, and Mr. W. Barnes was to
beare him company, where he assured me before Mr. Barnes that
I should be well dealt withall, confessyng former promisses by
himself, Mr. Manyryng, and his agreement for me with my Cosen
Shakspeare.</p>
</div>

<p>Yet during the whole of the struggle Thomas Greene honestly
threw himself into the duties of defending the rights
of the town which had reposed trust in him, “and was
much excepted to for his opposition” by the other side. It
is probable that Shakespeare was in the same position.</p>

<p>Now we come to the last entry of his name. It is known
to all Shakespeareans that Dr. C. M. Ingleby was so interested
in this that he had a photographic facsimile made of
Greene’s Diary; had it transcribed by Dr. Edward Scott,
wrote an Introduction and Appendix himself, and published
these in a thin folio.</p>

<p>I referred to the copy at the British Museum to save
going down to Stratford to check my former notes made at
the Record Office there. After a great deal of time spent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
through an unexpected confusion I found in it, I was forced
to make a careful comparison, line by line, between the
facsimile and the transcript. At first this did not clear up
my difficulty; but, on my going through a second time, referring
to the dates alone, the cause of the confusion flashed
on me: <i>one of the pages of Greene’s Diary had been placed
out of order in the facsimile</i>, and Dr. Scott, who was supposed
to have worked from the original, must have followed
the facsimile. I went down to check the original last
month, and to see if there was anything to account for the
mistake. But there was nothing. The four leaves are
written down one side and up another, making in all eight
pages. It could only be the photographer’s blunder by
misnumbering the pages. Page seven should be read as
page six, and the dates then read consecutively. My difficulty
had lain in the fact that the year 1615 was made to
have had <i>two springs</i>. My re-arrangement, which has been
noted and initialed by Mr. Barwick in the Museum copy,
restores order. But this late correction does not put right
the blunder based on it by Dr. Ingleby, who says (p. vi, Introduction)
that this entry “records, five months after the
death of Shakespeare, the statement of Shakespeare himself.”
Now this statement was not recorded five months
<i>after</i>, but seven months <i>before</i>, the poet’s death.</p>

<p>Two other important points must be noted concerning
this entry: first, that though it was somewhat crowded in,
it was intended to be read straight on; and second, that
the memorandum of a man’s death was associated with it,
and has some relation to it. As it is written, it should be
read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>14 Aug. 1615. Mr. Barker [?] died.</p>

<p>Sept. W. Shakspeares tellyng J. Greene that I was not able to
beare the encloseinge of Welcombe.</p>

<p>5 Sept. his sendyng James for the executours of Mr. Barker [?]
to agree as ys said with them for Mr. Barker’s [?] interest.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>The subject of the old and only discussion about this
was, Did the “I” refer to Shakespeare or to Greene? It is
unlike the other letters of the first person generally used by
Greene, but he does occasionally use that form as a capital.
It could not be a mistake for “he” in writing; but it might
be so in thought and word, as Greene’s style is very elliptical
and careless in the Diary. The argument put forward
by Dr. Ingleby was, Why should Shakespeare tell one
brother what another said, as he was likely to know it, and
why think this fact important enough to be recorded, unless
it was a report that Shakespeare could not bear the enclosing
of Welcombe? This is perfectly reasonable, but it may
have been that gossip had said that Thomas Greene served
the corporation when he gave them advice and wrote their
letters, but that he naturally was friendly with the enclosers,
and likely to benefit by the enclosure. It might be
but a note of pleased surprise of Thomas Greene’s to find
that the poet had read his honest heart better than his more
worldly-minded brother had done.</p>

<p>But the new point I wish to add is that on 14th August
there is the record of the death of an inhabitant, and the
note for 5th September clearly carries on Shakespeare as the
subject, and shows that he it was who sent for the executors
to agree with them for the interest of the defunct. I wish
I could accept Dr. Scott’s rendering, and read it as “Mr.
Barker,” for the meaning would then be straight and clear—that,
seeing Shakespeare had had so much trouble over
that reserved rent of Mr. Barker for £27 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> on the
lease of the tithes, etc., he was about to buy this up and set
his estate free from any future danger. But alas! on referring
to the Stratford Burial Register I find the entry on the
day after, 15 August 1615: “Burial. Mr. Thomas Barbor,
gent.” I have had the entry tested by an expert, who assures
me there can be no mistake <i>there</i>.</p>

<p>I referred to the baptisms, and found there were two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
children born to “Thomas Barbor, gent., of Shottery,”
within a year or two before; and that five days before the
burial of Thomas Barbor was entered the “Burial of Joane,
wife of Thomas Barbor, gent.” So I am driven back to the
earlier pages of original, and there I find, on</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>7th April, 1615, being Goodfryday, Mr. Barber commyng to
Colledge to Mr. T. Combe about a debt he stood surety for
Mris Quyney, W. Combe willed his brother to shew Mr. Barber
noe favour, and threatned him that he should be served upp to
London within a fortnight (and so yt fell out).</p>
</div>

<p>This is also rendered in the transcript as “Barker,” but is
clearly “Barber” in the original, and it seems to me that
the action here recorded broke Mr. Barber’s fortunes and
health, his wife died, and he followed, and that William
Shakespeare, still willing to invest in “an odd yard land at
Shottery,” sent for the executors, to do what he could for
the deceased and his children as well as for Mrs. Quyney,
whose unlucky debt was the cause of Mr. Barber’s distress
and ruin. Coming back from the registers and miscellaneous
documents of Stratford-on-Avon, we must therefore read
the name as “Barber,” and not as “Barker,” however like
it may be. Mr. Barber had done some important work for
the corporation previously, and may have been an attorney.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>It had always been a matter of surprise to me that
Thomas Greene, who mentioned the death of Mr. Barber,
did not mention the death of Shakespeare. Perhaps there
was no need for him to make a memorandum of an event
so important to the town and himself. He goes on in his
dates regularly till he comes to the spring of 1616. Then
he notes:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>At Warwick Assises in Lent 1615-1616 my Lord Chief Justice
willed him [<i>i.e.</i>, W. Combe] to sett his heart at rest he should
neyther enclose nor lay downe any earrable, nor plowe any
auncient greensward.</p>
</div>

<p>And the last words which fell on Shakespeare’s ears were
the news that his judgment was right, and “that nothing
should be done.”</p>

<p>The Diary leaps on then till 4th September 1616, and says
little more of interest, but sufficient to show that Mr.
W. Combe was determined to defy the Lord Chief Justice
as well as the corporation, and go on with the enclosures
after Shakespeare’s death. Indeed, the details<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> of the
struggles during the next two years, as gleaned from the
corporation records, give the romantic tale how Stratford
then</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The little tyrant of its fields withstood.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Combes raged at the corporation, defied their arguments,
and threatened them with dire consequences for
defending the rights they had sworn to hand down to their
successors; the aldermen complained in every Court, and
went in their own persons, rather than risk sending messengers,
to throw down the fences and fill up the ditches
made by Combe’s servants, and some were wounded in
the free fight which ensued. William Combe was High
Sheriff of the county for one year during the struggle,
and was Justice of the Peace during its course, though he
seemed to hold himself above law and successive legal decisions.</p>

<p>Finally, however, he was summoned for contumacy before
the Privy Council, and, after he was brought to his
knees, was granted “absolution” in 1618-19, So Shakespeare’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
legal acumen was proved when in 1614 he said
“he thought nothing would be done”; but it took a long
time to prove it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XII">XII<br><span class="small">OTHER WILLIAM SHAKESPEARES</span></h2></div>


<p>Among Shakespeare’s contemporaries there were a
good many bearing both of his names, and the few
facts known concerning them become interesting, even
when clearly shown not to refer to the poet.</p>

<p>I found one curious entry in London, among the burials
in the registers of St. Clement Danes: “Jane Shackspeer,
daughter of Willm., 8 Aug. 1609.” This Jane <i>might have
been</i> the daughter of some country “William” temporarily
in town—<i>might</i> even have been a daughter of the poet.
But I think it much more likely that the father’s name was
written in error for “John.” The bitmaker of that name
had settled in the parish, and had a large family. He had
baptized a daughter “Jane” on 16th July 1608, of whom no
further notice appears in the register, if this entry does
not record her death. (See my “Shakespeare’s Family,”
p. 148.)</p>

<p>The Warwickshire Shakespeares seem to have favoured
the name of William. Christopher Shakespeare, of Packwood,
mentions in his will (proved 15th August 1558) a son
William, who may be the subject of other later references.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
A William priced the goods of “Robert Shakesper,
of Wroxall,” on 19th March 1565; and one of the same name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
did the same duty to the goods of John Pardu, of Snitterfield,
1569. John Shakespeare, of Wroxall, labourer, in his
will, 15th December 1574, speaks of his brothers William
and Nicholas. A William signed and sealed, as one of the
witnesses, a feoffment of lands in Wroxall, 27th June 1592;
and a William of Wroxall made his will on 17th November
1609 (see Ryland’s “Records of Wroxall”).</p>

<p>A youth, probably the son of Thomas Shakespeare,
shoemaker, of Warwick, was buried at St. Nicholas’s in
that town, when the poet was fifteen years old. The clerk
thought the manner of his death worth recording: “1579.
July Sexto die huius mensis sepultus fuit Gulielmus
Shaxper, qui demersus fuit in Rivulo aquæ qui vel vocatur
Avona.”<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Another William, of Coventry, shoemaker, made his will
18th March 1605-6.</p>

<p>I see no evidence that the William Shakespeare of the
Worcester Register, who applied for a marriage licence on
27th November 1582 was a different man from the poet,
who, the next day, had a licence granted to marry Anne
Hathaway. I have given my reasons elsewhere for believing
them to be one and the same, and so has Mr. J. W. Gray
in his “Shakespeare’s Marriage.” I have never come upon
any other Anne or Agnes recorded as the wife of a William
Shakespeare.</p>

<p>There was a William, however, of Hatton or Haseley,
who married, 6th January 1589, Barbara Stiffe, and who is
entitled “gentleman” when, on 14th March 1596, he baptized
<i>his daughter Susanna</i>! “Barbara, wife of Mr. William
Shakespeare,” was buried in February 1610. One can
hardly think this the same person who was associated with
John Weale: “John Weale granted to Job Throgmorton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
the cottage in which William Shakespeare dwelt at Haseley
4th March 1597” (Hist. MSS. Com. Rep., App. II, Davenport
MSS.).</p>

<p>In the Star Chamber proceedings there is the notice of a
fine “inter Willielmum Shackspeare et Georgium Shackspeare,
quer., et Thomam Spencer, arm., Christopherum
Flecknoe, et Thomam Thompson, deforc., de octo acris
pasturæ cum pertinentis in Claverdon alias Claredon,
12 Jac. I.”</p>

<p>Another William was in the habit of selling malt, lending
money, and sometimes borrowing it. He might have been
some of these others of the name, but he could not have
been the poet, as some suppose, because his bills, preserved
at Warwick Castle, continue until 1626.</p>

<p>The greatest number of Shakespeare entries in general,
and of those concerning William in particular, are found in
relation to Rowington. There had been residents of the
name for a long time in the parish. The early registers are
lost; but from the will of Richard Shakespeare, of Rowington,
weaver, we know that he had a son William and a
son Richard under twenty-three years of age on 15th June
1561. Another of the same name, called “Richard Shakspere
of Rowington, the elder,” mentioned in his will,
dated 6th September 1591, his sons John, Roger, Thomas,
William; and a third Richard’s will, of 13th November 1613,
show that he had four sons—William, Richard, Thomas,
and John. The eldest, William, had at the date of the will
a son John; the second, Richard, had four—Thomas,
William, Richard, John; and after the registers commence,
we find on 28th April 1619, William Shakespeare, son of
John Shakespeare, was baptized; and on 13th August of
the same year, “William, son of Thomas Shakespeare.”</p>

<p>The name of William Shakespeare appears in the list of
the trained soldiers of Rowington taken by Sir Fulke
Greville at Alcester on 23rd September 1605, probably the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
son of the second Richard, but erroneously, by some,
supposed to have been the poet. Collier says that “we
have intelligence regarding no other William Shakespeare
at that date.”</p>

<p>The mark of a William Shakespere is found on a roll
of the jurors at the Court of the Manor of Rowington in
1614, which is almost certainly that of William, son of the
third Richard.</p>

<p>Mr. Ryland’s “Records of Rowington” show us that a
lease was granted through feoffees to Richard Shakespeare,
of Rowington, weaver, of the “Tyinges,” which may refer
either to Richard the second or the third. The Customary
rent of Rowington in 1605 mentions “Richard Shakespere,
one messuage, half a yearde land (14 acres), 14<i>s.</i>; John
Shakespeare one cottage and one quarter yard land (9 acres),
6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d</i>,.; Thomas Shakesper, one close, 2<i>s.</i>; one tofte and
16 acres, 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>; one messuage, 10<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>” It is not clear
which “Thomas” it was. Richard and John are those
referred to in the legal proceedings which give the story of
their lives.</p>

<p>This Richard the third was evidently son of Richard the
first, and, as he was under twenty-three in 1561, would be
about seventy-six when he died in 1614. In consequence
of his will and actions a protracted litigation commenced.
The case somewhat resembles that of Jacob and Esau.
The youngest son, in the absence of his eldest brother,
prevailed on his father to disinherit him in his favour, and
the dispossessed brother did not bear his loss with equanimity.
Some of the facts were known to Malone, “Proleg.,”
ii, 15, note 8; and Mr. Cecil Monro had included some of
the references in his “Acta Cancellaria,” 1847. Mr. Knight
discovered, and Mr. Bruce published, the Star Chamber
Bill and answer in “Notes and Queries,” Third Series, xii,
p. 81 (3rd August 1867); and a list of the official entries collected
by Mr. Monro is given at p. 161 of the same volume.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>The Catalogue which, within the last few years, has been
drawn up of the Second Series of Chancery Proceedings
has given us access to still another paper; and as so many
minor illustrative details have turned up, it seems time to
make a <i>résumé</i> of the whole mass of material. The story
illustrates the domestic and legal life of the times.</p>

<p>Richard Shakespeare was of Turner’s End, or Church
End, Rowington, when he made his will on 13th November
1613. He did not trust to its being sufficient of itself to
go against the Customary of the manor, and during his
lifetime he surrendered his copyhold estate into the hands
of the steward by his attorneys, Thomas Ley and George
Whome, in order to “settle it upon himself and his wife
Elizabeth for their lives, and the longer liver of them, and
after their decease, upon his youngest son John and his
heirs,” provided that John paid to his brother William £4
a year. This deed of settlement was completed, and the
fine paid into Court, in March 1613-14. Richard died
within a month, and his wife followed him almost immediately,
repenting of her share in the arrangement. William
thereupon applied to be put on the homage of the manor,
as his father’s eldest son and heir, probably at the time he
made his mark; and also contested his mother’s will at
Worcester. (See MS. Episc. Reg. Worcester, “per Wilielmus
Shakespere, filium naturalem Elizabeth Shakespere nuper
de Rowenton.”)<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> But the combination against him had
been too powerful. He had no remedy but to eat humble-pie
and accept the first instalment of his yearly fee from
his brother John at Michaelmas 1614. When John had
claimed his inheritance at the Manorial Court, the steward
had bidden him be cautious with that proviso, or he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
forfeit it, as it devised it to be paid in two portions, at the
two half-yearly feasts of Lady Day and Michaelmas,
between the hours of ten in the morning and two of the
afternoon, in the church porch of Rowington. At Lady Day
1615 difficulties arose. Each said the other did not keep
the appointment. William was not paid at the time
specified in the settlement, and, assuming that the premises
were thereby forfeited, made an entry into his father’s
house as his natural heir, and was forcibly resisted. He
thereupon instituted a case in Common Law. John went
above him, and filed a bill in Chancery against him. Mr.
Cecil Monro collected the following entries of this case:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Bill in Chancery, filed 1st May 1616, John contra
William Shakespeare.</p>

<p>2. 11th May 1616, L. C. Ellesmere’s order to stay proceedings
of defendant in Court Baron of Rowington until

<p>9. 18th November, Mr. Moore desired to consider the
sufficiency of the answer of the defendants (<i>ibid.</i>, f. 192).</p>

<p>10. Master Moore’s report in favour of plaintiff, Michaelmas
Term, 1617 (Monro’s “Acta Cancellaria,” p. 222).</p>

<p>11. 22nd November 1619, an order for an injunction to
restrain the defendant from putting plaintiff out of the
possession of the premises at Rowington, and from suing
plaintiff at Common Law upon a bond of £500, until
defendant had answered plaintiff’s bill (Lib. B, 1619,
f. 300).</p>

<p>12. 27th November 1619, an order for attachment against
the defendant for not appearing.</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Monro here omits the reply of William, filed on
6th May 1616, which should have come between 1 and 2.
No. 4 refers to the reply to this, which should have
appeared between 5 and 6; but it seems to have been lost.</p>

<p>Mr. Moore’s report of 16th May is favourable to John,
whom he believes <i>willing</i> to pay, and the supposed forfeiture,
if any, incurred by his reposing trust in another
brother. Plaintiff might be relieved (Monro’s “Acta Cancellaria,”
p. 221). But in his supplementary report he
explains the “relief” to be only until <i>decision</i>. From the
later Star Chamber case we know that the appointment of
the commission of inquiry in Warwick should come in between
6 and 7 (13th January 1616-17). Mr. Moore’s report
in Michaelmas Term 1617 is favourable to William, who
should have the premises, if annuity not paid; and he finds
the answers of the defendants defective (Monro’s “Acta
Cancellaria,” p. 222).</p>

<p>In this counter case of “William contra John,” Mr. Monro
omits to mention another paper, lately found by Mr. J. W.
Gray and by myself, “The further answer of John Shakespeare,
Edmund Fowler, and Thomas Sadler, defendants,
to the bill of complaint of William Shakespeare, complainant.”
It is not dated in the draft, but written across
the top is a note in another hand, “Sworn 27th Jan., 1617<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
Matthew Carew,” <i>i.e.</i>, 1617-18 (Chanc. Proc., Ser. II, Bundle
291, S. No. 108).</p>

<p>In spite of Mr. Moore’s favourable report, the case was
evidently decided against William, in Easter Term 1618,
by Sir Julius Cæsar, on the sworn evidence of Thomas
Shakespeare, Fowler, and Sadler. William filed a bill in
the Star Chamber as to their perjury, 9th June 1618, which
was replied to on 11th June. The result is not preserved.</p>

<p>In the course of the depositions, both sides agreed as to
preliminary facts; both allowed John to have been the
father’s favourite son; they differed as to the cause of
Richard’s action. John stated that “William had for many
years been undutiful and disobedient, and taken very unnatural
and wicked courses, to his father’s great grief.”
William explained that until he was forty years of age he
had worked as a labourer on his father’s farm without
wages, only receiving his meat, drink, and garments. His
father had never even allowed him any stock that he might
raise up means to live on. He had done this, believing that
the farm would later be his own, as his father always said
it should. But about ten years before his father’s death he
had gone into service, with his father’s permission, that he
might earn some money, and “might be able to bestow his
brothers and his sister, and fare in personal estate the
better.” It is not so stated, but one can read between the
lines, that he wanted to marry, and did marry, a certain
well-to-do Mrs. Margery. When, through service on other
people’s property, he “had gotten some money into his
purse, he lent and bestowed much on his brother Richard,
and did also, in all dutiful manner, respect and use his
father and mother, and did him many services to his good
liking.” But the ageing father had doubtless missed the
strong arms of his son, all the more that they had not been
duly appreciated. While William was away, working for
money, John was at home, weaving, and not only John,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
but his sister Joan, whom his father loved exceedingly.
Joan preferred her younger brother, and the two combined
to obtain for him the property “by false information and
other sinister means.” John used every means in his power
to keep William away. Even when his father sent for him,
John shut the door in his face and would violently assault
him, threatening William that “if he hindered him from
getting the premises, he would keep him in prison all his
life for it.” The action of John and Joan “was very hardly
spoken of among the neighbours.” Their mother had encouraged
them at the time, but on her death-bed she bitterly
repented, and “asked William to forgive her, and to
pray to God to forgive her too.” William had submitted
until John had broken the proviso. John’s bill in Chancery,
1st May 1616 (Bills and Answers, James I, Bundle S. 1457),
is an appeal to be protected against the intrusions of
William, who had injured him, and maltreated his cattle,
turning them out of his pasture. He said he had fulfilled
the conditions of the deed, and at the said Lady Day 1615
“did by himself, or some one for him, tender the money
between the hours of 10 and 2.” He had gone to the
church porch between 11 and 12, but, William not being
there, he departed about other business, leaving the money
with his brother Thomas, supposing that William would
either come or send for it. Thomas waited in the church
porch, but William did not come, and he sent it to his
house the next day: but William, “being of a contentious
and troublesome spirit, and seeking and endeavouring by
all means to trouble your orator and put him to unnecessary
expense, refused it.” “The said William Shakespeare,
the <i>6th of April last</i>, at a Court holden for the manor, did
make claim to the messuage as the eldest son and heir of
Richard Shakespeare,” pretending that it had been forfeited;
and “except for the Equity of Chancery, your said
orator is altogether remediless.” It may easily be seen that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
John’s statement as to the tender was somewhat indefinite.
William’s answer is clear (filed 6th May, not included in
Mr. Monro’s list). He had gone to the church porch of
Rowington, not, indeed, at 10 o’clock, but shortly after 12,
and waited until 3 o’clock. He had “openly published the
cause of his coming there, and many took notice thereof”;
but neither John, nor any one for him came thither to pay.
John, indeed, had ridden off to Warwick, four miles away,
on pleasure. William therefore, “considering how John, by
indirect and undue means, had gotten the inheritance,”
and believing that he by neglect of this proviso had forfeited
it, lawfully entered into the premises as his father’s
legal heir, in a peaceable manner, along with his wife. He
<i>had</i> turned some cattle out of the pasture, but quite gently,
and they did not belong to his brother, but to Thomas
Ley. Here something is implied, which is not expressly
stated. John was his own master, and could fix his own
hours; William, still at service, was not master of his own
time. Hence he was late at the appointment, and hence
his wife, and not himself, made the later “forcible entries,”
referred to as his. He goes on to say that he had heard
that his “wife had been uncivilly beaten and buffeted
about the head, and at one time was bruised upon the
breast that it wrankled,” and her nursing child fell ill in
consequence. This had been done by John, Thomas Ley
helping him, “who, in a most violent and unchristian
manner, did take the shoe from his foot” to strike her.
John had falsely excused himself that Margery had attacked
his wife. William confessed that he had laid claim
to the premises at the Court held on 6th April last, and that
by all lawful means he intends to have and to hold them.
He is sure that he was not paid, and he knows nothing of
John or his representative waiting in the church porch.</p>

<p>The further answer of John Shakespeare and others of
27th January 1617-18, also omitted by Mr. Monro, suggests<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
either that by some curious but not impossible coincidence,
one party went out of the church porch just the minute
before the other came in, and that more than once, or that
one or the other committed perjury. It is too long to transcribe,
and most of it is recited in the Star Chamber case.
John denied William’s statement that on Lady Day 1615,
“relying on his craft and subtilty, accompanied only by
Henry Clarke, minister, he did, near the church porch,
tender the forty shillings,” and go off to Warwick on
pleasure, leaving neither money nor representative. He
stated that “about 12 of the clock he came into the church
porch, and did tender the money, but neither William nor
any one for him was there to receive it.” He had “heard
it reported that the complainant had threatened to cut off
an arm or a legg,” and he therefore went home to dinner,
and afterwards went to Warwick, where he had business,
as it was market day. Before he left, he gave the money to
his brother Thomas, with direction and authority to pay it
to William, or any other for him, and to stay at the church
porch until the last instant, to be able to tender the money.
Thomas Shakespeare had told him, and he thinks he can
prove it, that he did stay until after two o’clock, and at the
last instant did tender the money in presence of these two
witnesses, Edmund Fowler and Thomas Sadler, who say
that Thomas entreated them to be present with him. They
met him, as they were coming to see him; about a quarter
of a mile from Rowington, and went to the church porch
about half-past one and they stayed until the last instant,
or “neere thereabout,” and saw him tender the money at
2 o’clock; but neither William nor any for him was present.
They deny that they or any of them have “contrived
any secret estates, surrenders, articles, or agreements,” concerning
this business. They are quite willing to answer
further in any point “not sufficiently answered, confessed,
avoided, and reversed or denied,” and trust this honourable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
Court may give them their reasonable costs and charges
wrongfully sustained. It is signed by Ric. Weston.</p>

<p>The Star Chamber case six months later, 9th June 1618,
transcribed in full in “Notes and Queries,” 3rd August 1867,
after reciting the bulk of the Chancery proceedings, continues
the plea. William’s complaint shows that John at
first said <i>he</i> had stayed until 2 o’clock or near thereabout.
He acknowledges there may have been a tender between
11 and 12, but there was none afterwards. He tells us that
a commission from Chancery had been sent to John
Norton, gent., Francis Collins, gent.,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Thomas Warner,
clerk, and John Greene, gent., to examine the witnesses at
Warwick, 13th January 1616. (This commission sat between
the dates of Mr. Cecil Monro’s entries 6 and 7.) He there
denounces “the wicked, ungodly, and corrupt subornacion
of the said John and Thomas, of Edmund Fowler, tailor,
Thomas Sadler, hempdresser, both of Coventry, who
answered falsely, untruely, corruptly, and unlawfully” that
they had come and seen Thomas tender the money between
half-past 1 and 2 o’clock, and the money lay on the bench
all the time until 2 o’clock, when they went away together,
Thomas Shakespeare to Killingworth, Sadler and Fowler
to Coventry. William declares their deposition false, untrue,
and corrupt, to the displeasure of Almighty God,
contrary to the laws of the “Realme,” and to the king’s
peace, crown, and dignity, and to the great prejudice of
him, whose case in Chancery was decreed against him by
Sir Julius Cæsar in Easter Term last. He says he has no
hope except the equity of the Star Chamber.</p>

<p>On the 11th of June John and the other defendants
reply, supporting their previous assertions, saying that
William was not present at 2 o’clock, and as “to all the
perjuries, falsities, and corruptions, they are not guilty.”</p>

<p>The decision has not been preserved, nor the initiation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
of a third Chancery suit. But the two Chancery orders of
1619 referred to by Mr. Monro belong to this later series.</p>

<p>It is relevant to the question to return to the records of
Rowington. The action does not seem to have prejudiced
William with his neighbours, because in 1622, only three
years after the last notice in Chancery, he was elected
churchwarden. As a churchwarden had to be a “substantial
householder,” this implies that William had been left in
possession of his dearly bought inheritance. It also suggests
a great change in his prospects from the time in
which he sued <i>in forma pauperis</i>; or a desire of the neighbours
to show their respect for him. John was buried
5th May 1635; William on 20th February 1646-7.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Their long-continued litigation must have stirred not
only Rowington, but Warwickshire, and it must have been
well known to the poet. For he, too, was a homager of the
manor of Rowington, for one of the only two tenements
belonging to that manor in Stratford-on-Avon—the property
in Chapel Lane taken over by his brother Gilbert for
him in 1602. For that tenement, therefore, he should have
been on the jury at Rowington, at the Court in April
1614, when, immediately after his father’s death, William
claimed his inheritance; or in the following April, when
he claimed it as forfeited. Though, from reasonable causes,
he might have been excused attendance, the poet was
certain to know of all the cases brought before the Court.
It is probable that he sympathized with the elder brother,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
who had been ousted from the headship of the family, a
man of his own name, exactly of his own age, possibly
related to him in some degree, with the same number of
brothers as he, and also with one sister, Joan. One trifling
fact suggests acquaintanceship and sympathy—that William’s
case was taken up by, and developed and signed by,
Thomas Greene, the poet’s cousin and attorney of Stratford-on-Avon,
when, a week after Shakespeare’s death, the
younger brother interfered with the course of Common
Law by throwing it into Chancery.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XIII">XIII<br><span class="small">THE TRUE STORY OF THE STRATFORD BUST</span></h2></div>


<p>Our poverty in respect of authenticated likenesses of
our great dramatist, makes us the more eager to learn
all that we can concerning the only two that have been
universally accepted, and even makes us patient in hearing
what can be said in favour of others more or less doubtful
in their pedigree. Therefore, it is all the more surprising
that one authentic rendering, produced by a Warwickshire
man, who was eleven years of age when the poet died,
should have been entirely ignored by all the numerous
writers on “Shakespeare’s Portraits,” especially as it has a
most important bearing on the determination of the facial
characteristics of the great dramatist. To understand this
fully, due consideration must first be given to what are
recognized as the “undoubted portraits.”</p>

<p>That which was publicly put forward as the poet’s likeness,
and accepted as such by his contemporaries, was the
inartistically designed, and coarsely executed engraving of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
Droeshout, appearing as frontispiece to the First Folio
Edition of the Plays, brought out by his fellows, Heminge
and Condell, in 1623.</p>

<p>There was no English <i>art</i> at the time worthy of the
name, and probably for this reason the people found a
double charm in theatrical representations. The actors
supplied them with concrete images of the characters
whose life-stories interested them, and became to them
more closely identified than any historical portraits are
to-day with their originals. Artistic taste and judgment
were unknown amongst ordinary people, and even literary
men, except such as had had special training, could not be
held as art-critics of any importance. Hence, we may be
justified in considering Ben Jonson’s fulsome praise of
Droeshout, in his desire to help the editors, as only possible
to him through his deficiency in artistic sense.</p>

<p>Bad art as Droeshout’s is, it nevertheless conveys to us
the information that Shakespeare had a high forehead,
prematurely bald, fine eyes, long straight nose, small moustache
and beard, clean-shaven cheeks, oval face, and rather
long hair. The dress is of rather less importance, as it
might have been his own, or that of some character in
which he had acted. The painting from which the engraving
was taken has long been sought for. Some thought it
had been found in the so-called Felton portrait. The right
panel of this had been split off in the middle of the collar,
and the foot shortened to make it fit a frame. It has some
details <i>similar</i> to, but not identical with, those of the engraving,
though it has a little more art in the workmanship,
and a little more expression in the features. On the back
is written, “Guil. Shakespeare 1597,” and two letters, “R.B.,”
supposed to stand for Richard Burbage. Notwithstanding
much that was unsatisfactory in its pedigree, Richardson
restored the hair, collar, and dress after Droeshout, and
published it, whence have arisen many reproductions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>A much more important rival has, comparatively lately,
turned up. Though its pedigree also is hazy, the likeness
to the Droeshout print is undoubted, and Mrs. Flower of
Stratford-on-Avon purchased it, and presented it to the
Memorial Picture Gallery in 1895. Mr. Lionel Cust,
Director of the National Portrait Gallery, read a paper
about it before the Society of Antiquaries, 12th December
1895, in which he accepted it as genuine. It is, of course,
open to the questions whether the picture was painted <i>for</i>
the engraving or <i>from</i> the engraving, and whether it had
been painted before or after the poet’s death. The expression
is better than that of the engraving.</p>

<p>The first reproduction of Droeshout, after the Second
Folio, is that which appeared as frontispiece to “Shakespeare’s
Poems” in 1640. The engraver, Marshall, turned
the face the other way, increased the inanity of the expression,
flung a cloak over one shoulder, and put a spray of
laurel in the poet’s hand. “This shadow is renowned
Shakespeare’s,” etc. William Faithorne introduced it into
the frontispiece of “The Rape of Lucrece,” 1658. Very
many varieties of these two engravings have appeared.</p>

<p>The chief rival of the Felton and Flower Portraits is the
Chandos portrait, which has a long pedigree. If there is
any weakness in the chain of evidence for the authenticity
of this portrait, it is only in the first links. It was <i>said</i> to
have been painted either by Burbage, or by Taylor, the
player, to have remained in the possession of the latter
until his death, and to have been left by him to Sir William
Davenant. It is no objection to this likeness that it should
have rings in the ear, because the custom of wearing a rose
in the ear was so common among the <i>jeunesse dorée</i> of
Elizabethan times, that it was quite natural that an actor
should have his ears pierced. But one always feels a little
in doubt of the good faith of Davenant, because of his
known desire to be thought like Shakespeare. The picture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
passed from Davenant to Betterton. While in that actor’s
possession, Kneller painted a <i>portrait</i> from it, which was
presented to Dryden. This came afterwards into the possession
of Earl Fitzwilliam. The original passed from
Betterton to Mrs. Barry, Mr. Keck, Mr. Nicholls, whose
daughter married the Marquis of Carnarvon, afterwards
Duke of Chandos, and thence to his daughter, who married
the Duke of Buckingham. The picture was bought by the
Earl of Ellesmere in 1848, and presented to the nation on
the founding of the National Portrait Gallery.</p>

<p>The first engraving taken from it was by Van der Gucht
for Rowe’s “Shakespeare,” 1709.</p>

<p>Many other oil paintings and miniatures of unproven
authenticity have been put forward as likenesses of the
poet, but so diverse are they in their characteristics, that it
is impossible that they can be all genuine.</p>

<p>Some fine conceptions based upon composite ideas, others
avowedly works of imagination, have been evolved in stone,
glass, and oil paintings through the centuries. There is dignity
in the Kent and Scheemacher’s statue at Westminster,
in the Roubiliac statue, genius in Lord Ronald Gower’s group,
and there is pre-Raphaelite art in Ford Madox Brown’s rendering
of 1849, but there is no space here to discuss these
and other artistic productions. They teach us no <i>facts</i>.</p>

<p>The Stratford bust should possess a stronger claim to
antiquity and authenticity even than the Droeshout engraving.
It is referred to in the First Folio by Leonard
Digges, as having been already set up by the time he
wrote. It was designed under the supervision of Shakespeare’s
widow, daughters, and sons-in-law, amidst his
friends and kinsfolk, who knew him as a man, not as an
actor, and they had it <i>coloured</i>, so that the likeness, if at
all good, should have been much more striking than the
work of the engraver. They, too, suffered from a plentiful
lack of art in their sculptor, Gerard Johnson, and from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
their own deficiency in critical judgement. But there is
every reason to believe that they did their best to represent
him to the life. They loved him, and they were rich enough
to pay for the best they could get.</p>

<p>Yet every one who approaches the Stratford bust is
more disappointed in it, as a revelation of the poet, than
even in the crude lines of Droeshout. There is an entire
lack of the faintest suggestion of poetic or spiritual inspiration
in its plump earthliness. The designer has put a pen
and paper into the hands, after the manner of the school-boy,
who wrote under the drawing of something-on-four-legs,
“this is a horse.” The pen strives to write “this is
a literary man,” but there is nothing to support the attribution.
The intensely disappointing nature of this supposed
simulacrum of the poet, made me, years ago, commence a
careful study of all his known representations, whether
founded on fact or based on imagination. A good deal has
been written on the subject from the time of Boaden’s
“Inquiry,” 1824. In 1827 Mr. Abraham Wivell brought
out a book upon Shakespeare’s portraits, criticizing the
opinions of Steevens, Malone, and Boaden, and since then
many successive writers have more fully classified and
illustrated the varieties, and brought our knowledge of
them up to date. But none of them gave me what I wanted,
an early representation of the Stratford original bust. I
therefore commenced to search with a purpose, and in the
very first book I opened I found what I sought, a representation
of the tomb as it appeared little more than twenty
years after its erection.</p>

<p>This was, of course, in Sir William Dugdale’s great “History
of the Antiquities of Warwickshire.” He seems, judging
from the notes in his diary, to have prepared his work in the
neighbourhood of Stratford-on-Avon about 1636, though the
publication was delayed by the civil wars for twenty years.</p>

<p>His representation of Shakespeare’s bust is therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
entitled to respect as the earliest known engraving, though
it has never been calendared, compared, or criticized. The
unsatisfactory, or rather, in some aspects, the satisfactory
fact is, that <i>it differs in all important details from the bust
as it appears now</i>. We have here also, doubtless, to grapple
with the lack of art-perception in the draughtsman and of
the engraver, but there are simple leading distinctions,
that could not have been imagined, if there had not been
something to suggest them. Far from resembling the self-contented
fleshy man of to-day, the large and full dark
eyes look out of cheeks hollow to emaciation. The moustache
drops down softly and naturally instead of perking
upwards, there is no mantle on the shoulders, no pen in the
hand, no cushioned desk. The arms are bent awkwardly,
the hands are laid stiffly, palms downward, on a large
cushion, suspiciously resembling a <i>woolsack</i>. It is not unlike
an older Droeshout, and the Death-mask might be
considered anew beside it. The engraving is, of course,
open to the interpretation that Dugdale, or his draughtsman,
was careless and inexact in details. In order to compare
his work in other examples, I asked a friend to take a
photograph of Sir Thomas Lucy’s tomb, as pictured in Dugdale,
and another from the original, which has been very little
restored since it was sculptured in Shakespeare’s time. He
took that from the book, but found that the tomb itself
was in a very bad light for photography, and sent me
instead a pencil outline. This supports Dugdale’s rendering
of important details, though he failed somewhat, naturally,
in catching the expression. It allows us to believe that he
reproduced Shakespeare’s bust with some degree of fidelity.
He was appreciative of his fellow countryman’s fame, and
would not pass him by as a nobody. It is quite possible,
indeed, that he had seen the poet in habit as he lived, and
any divergence from the tomb would be more than likely
to be in the direction of the reality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>I had reached this stage when I consulted Dr. Richard
Garnett. He reminded me that the little red lions that
held the railings on the outer front pavement of the British
Museum had been wont to be considered great works of
art, but modern critics could not praise them. On their
being taken down a few years ago, however, in order to
broaden the pavement, one of them was subjected to a
severe cleansing process, which proved that it was nothing
but the successive coats of paint, liberally applied every
three years, which had obscured the art of the original
conception. His question therefore was, had Shakespeare’s
bust been repainted frequently enough to cause the plump
unpoetic appearance it now has. I could not think so,
because no amount of painting would alter the position of
the arms, the shape of the hands, or throw a mantle over
the figure.</p>

<p>I had therefore to have recourse again to engravings,
and went through those in the Print-room of the British
Museum. There I found a curious engraving in the Slade
collection, signed “Grignion sculps,” which support’s Dugdale’s
rendering. I then went through every illustrated
copy of Shakespeare in the British Museum, a large order
for the attendants. Rowe, in his first edition of Shakespeare’s
works, 1709, has a very bad representation of the
tomb, which conveys the idea of a certain amount of decay
in the original. There is absolutely no expression in the
face, which is not quite so thin as Dugdale’s, but the figure
agrees with the early rendering in all points in which it
differs from the modern one. Rowe’s edition of 1714 presents
a bad copy of his first edition. In Pope’s edition of
1725, we find a remarkable variation. Vertue did not go
to Stratford but to Rowe for his copy. Finding it so very
inartistic, he <i>improved</i> the monument, making the little
angels light-bearers rather than bearers of spade and hour-glass,
and instead of the bust he <i>gives a composition from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
the Chandos portrait</i>, altering the arms and hands, and
adding a cloak, pen, paper, and desk. It retains, however,
the drooping moustache and slashed sleeves. In Sir Thomas
Hanmer’s edition, 1744, Gravelot copies from Vertue the
monument and the figure, while he alters the face into
what seems to be the original of what is called <i>The Birthplace
Portrait</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Thomas in 1730 expanded Dugdale’s “Warwickshire”
into two volumes, but used the original block of the tomb
unaltered.</p>

<p>Before the middle of the eighteenth century we know
that the tomb was “very much decayed.” Mr. John Ward,
the grandfather of Mrs. Siddons, was in Stratford in 1746,
and gave the whole proceeds of a representation of
“Othello” in the Town Hall on 8th September towards the
restoration of Shakespeare’s tomb. Orders were given “to
beautify” as well as to repair it. We are left altogether in
the dark as to the degree of decay and the amount of reconstruction,
but that it was considerable seems evident.
By 1749 the repairs were completed, and the colours repainted
by Mr. John Hall, a limner of Stratford-on-Avon.
Probably they worked with the <i>new</i> edition of Shakespeare
before them as a guide, depending upon Gravelot and Hanmer
of 1744. Alas for the result! We may apply Browning’s
words, in another sense than he meant them, to the
fate of this honoured memorial:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>
<p>Whoever the sculptor was who so much <i>improved</i> the
figure, it is more than likely he restored the face by the aid
of some cement. It is curious that none of the other editions
of the eighteenth century reproduce the tomb either
as Vertue or Gravelot rendered it. None, indeed, reproduce
it at all, until we come to the second edition of Bell’s
“Shakespeare,” 1788, into which he introduces the “Life”
from Rowe’s second edition of 1714, and in the “Life” the
representation of the tombstone according to that edition.
It was engraved by Reynold Grignion, and “printed for
Bell’s ‘Shakespeare,’ 1st Dec. 1786.” This fact, printed on the
plate itself, is important, as Grignion died in 1787, and the
book came out in 1788. He rather improved on Rowe’s
print, as Bell’s other engravers improved upon the Droeshout
and the Marshall copies. Bad as it is, it represents
the same figure as Dugdale did, falling into decay. This
engraving is the same as that in the British Museum,
“Grignion sculps,” so the latter may have been a proof copy.</p>

<p>All later renderings are of the modern type. Then commenced
a new series of vicissitudes for the <i>restored</i> bust.
Not so very long after the repairs it was taken down from
its pedestal, so that Mr. Malone might take a cast from it.
More than likely that was the time when some accident removed
the tip of the restored nose, which has left the
“long upper lip” a marvel to many since the days of Sir
Walter Scott. William Henry Ireland, in his “Confessions,”
1805, states that he had been down taking drawings from
various tombs in Stratford, and “greatly reprehended the
folly of having coloured the face and dress of the bust of
Shakespeare, which was intended to beautify it, whereas it
would have been much more preferable to have left the
stone of the proper colour.” He applied for leave to “take
a plaster-cast from the bust as Mr. Malone had done,” but
the necessary delay in petitioning the Corporation for permission
made him give up the idea. In his drawing of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
bust, he makes Shakespeare an eighteenth-century gentleman,
moustache turned up, a pen in one hand, paper in the
other, and the cushion like a desk. An engraving was made
by Mr. William Ward, A.R.A., from a painting by Thomas
Phillips, R.A., after a cast taken by Bullock from the bust,
and published by Lake on 23rd April 1816, the second centenary
after the poet’s decease. This has the cloak, the
pen, and the paper.</p>

<p>We are, therefore, in the bust likeness confronted by
greater difficulties than the mere obscuring of the truth by
paint, such as occurred in the case of the British Museum
lions. We have to consider the much more serious question,
the degree to which the features and surroundings of
the original, deliberately or unconsciously, have been tampered
with. It would seem that the sculptor who collaborated
with Hall in 1746 was the culprit who deprived us of
the original outlines of a memorial so dear, either through
ignorance, vanity, or culpable carelessness. He had Dugdale
to consult had he so pleased, but he contented himself
with Hanmer. The decay must have been serious, and the
alteration fundamental, to have so obscured the design.
Mr. John Hall, who was responsible for the colouring, was
believed to have followed the tints of the original. Be that
as it may, Mr. Malone, like Mr. Ireland, disapproved of
them, and in order to suit his own taste, and the fashion of
his age, he persuaded the Corporation to have it painted
white in 1793. One contemporary, however, wrote in the
album of Stratford-on-Avon Church the lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Stranger, to whom this monument is shewn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Invoke the Poet’s curse upon Malone</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose meddling zeal his barbarous taste displays</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And daubs his tomb-stone as he marred his plays.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The bust was repainted in 1861 after the <i>original</i> colouring
by the artist who <i>discovered</i> what has been called The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
Stratford Portrait, still reverently preserved at the birthplace,
though it has no claim to authenticity. Its strong resemblance
to the bust is of itself suspicious.</p>

<p>We suffer now, therefore, from the combined action of
the various improvers and restorers of Gerard Johnson’s
clumsy workmanship. Though the crude colours of Hall
shocked the sensibilities of Malone, he thought it no sacrilege
to have the bust taken down, and submitted to the
moulder’s mercenary hands. Several others have been allowed
to sin in a similar way. Many have written discourses
upon its physiognomy, and based arguments and fancies
upon it, unwitting of all these facts.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> It is comforting to be
able to go back to the simple rendering of Dugdale from
the original—not a picturesque or poetic rendering, of what
was probably a poor representation. But in it there <i>is</i>
something biographical, something suggestive; it shows us
the tired creator of poems, exhausted from lack of sleep,
“Nature’s sweet restorer,” weary of the bustling London
life, who had returned, as soon as possible, to seek rest at
home among his own people, and met an over-early death
in the unhealthy spring-damps of 1616. A happy suggestion
of the thoughtful poetic soul, of which the modern restored
and adapted representation had deprived us, but only a
suggestion. We sadly ask, where is the true likeness of our
Shakespeare? and Leonard Digges speaks for us when he
says that it is to be found in</p>

<i>“Murray’s Monthly Review,” April 1904, and pamphlet reprinted from it, same date.</i>
</p>

<p>PS.—When I wrote the above paper I called it “An Uncalendared
Presentment of Shakespeare,” as no one had placed the drawing in
the lists of credited or discredited likenesses. Dr. Gollancz and
Dr. Furnivall altered the title, and the Editor accepted it, though
I always thought the new title too aggressive for <i>my</i> meaning.
Since in it I first drew attention to the discrepancies between
Dugdale’s representation and the present tomb, there have been
many heated discussions about it. Sentimentalists did not like
the notion that there had been <i>any</i> change in the precious
memorial, <i>critical</i> sentimentalists, seeking for some support of
their opinion, satisfied themselves that these discrepancies only
proved the inexactitudes of Dugdale. Baconians accepted Dugdale
eagerly, as they do accept everything that they think can be made
to seem derogatory to Shakespeare in any way. Thereby they
obscured the whole question, and ignored my work and statements.
Good Shakespeareans thought they had demolished me
in discrediting the value of Dugdale’s testimony. The two last
articles published by Mr. Andrew Lang were on this subject,
and it took a large place in the book published since his death,
but I have not been allowed to reply to these. Mr. Robertson,
who had ignored my “Bacon-Shakespeare Question” in his
“Baconian Heresy,” also ignored my article on this subject, and
says: “Incidentally by reproducing Dugdale’s version of the
Carew Monument in Stratford, and confronting it with a photograph
of the actual monument, he has exploded the small mystery
built up by Mr. Greenwood, out of the difference between the
actual Shakespeare Monument and Dugdale’s representation of it
in 1656.” Mr. Greenwood had expressed strong faith in Dugdale’s
general correctness, and had quoted Dr. Whitaker to the effect
that “his scrupulous accuracy, united with his stubborn integrity,
has elevated his ‘Antiquities of Warwickshire’ to the rank of legal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
evidence.” Mr. Lang in 1912 said: “Mrs. Stopes argues that the
monument was entirely reconstructed....” “It is positively
certain her opinion is erroneous.” Then he gives as his absolute
<i>proof</i>, the Carew Monument in Stratford. (For the reversing of the
position of the recumbent figures from north to south, we probably
have to thank a printer’s accidental reversal of plate.) But
Mr. Lang’s argument contains not one, but <i>two</i> logical fallacies.
In the first place it claims to <i>prove</i> that because Dugdale was
incorrect in one monument he must have been incorrect in all.
There may have been special reasons for the carelessness; if any,
Dr. Thomas has suggested them in his second edition. And the
argument <i>against</i> is no stronger than the argument <i>for</i> Dugdale,
in that the Lucy tomb is a fair representation of the present one,
and therefore reasoning from it, he might be treated as correct.
There were special reasons that Dugdale should have taken
extra care with Shakespeare’s tomb, because he mentions the
poet in his text as an honour to his native town, and Dugdale
knew it well.</p>

<p>Mr. Lang’s second fallacy is more important. It is the old
logical fallacy of <i>accident</i>, or, as some logicians put it, “of cooked
meat.” I had definitely refused to accept as witness against
Dugdale’s trustworthiness the evidence of any other tomb which
had also been “repaired and beautified.” Now the Clopton tomb
has been “repaired and beautified,” and therefore, without some
stronger support, it has no convincing power at all. I fear that I
made a little confusion by my use of the word “fundamental,” for
Mr. Lang seems to have attached a wider meaning to it than I did.
If I may take a woman’s simile, I may make it clear. When a
woman sends an old dress to be “repaired and beautified,” it may
be relined, turned, the worn pieces cut out and replaced, alterations
made in design to make up for losses by wear, trimmings
laid on to cover seams, and yet after all it would remain <i>the same
dress</i>, and her male friends might notice no change in it. But the
dressmaker would call it, as to her work, a <i>fundamental</i> change.
I saw that it was by some such process that it was <i>possible</i> to
harmonize the discrepancies. I did not start wishing to prove any
particular point. I did not even want to prove myself right, for I
have no prejudices about it, I only wanted to seek for, and to find
<i>the truth</i>. None of my opponents have done any original work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
concerning this matter, and therefore <i>the question</i> stands exactly
where it did, <i>i.e.</i> Dugdale’s representation is different from what
the tomb is to-day. Why is it so? The two answers are, Dugdale’s
representation was incorrect, or, the tomb has been modified.</p>

<p>Since I wrote the paper, I have done a good deal of further
work on it. I found the contemporary letters of “the restorers,”
1746-9, published them in the “Pall Mall Gazette,” and have
reprinted them now in my Note XIII. I have also gone through all
the consecutive <i>history</i> of the Bust. Dugdale himself tells us his
method of going through the country, by hundreds, and by rivers,
<i>beginning with the Avon</i>. He says that he asked the nearest heirs
of the famous individuals whose monuments he had inserted, to
co-operate with him, to give him information, and, where possible,
to pay the expenses of the plates. At the time he wished Shakespeare’s
bust to be prepared, the poet’s daughters, granddaughter,
and son-in-law, Thomas Quiney, were still alive, and would be
more or less able to criticize. But Mrs. Susanna Hall died in
1649, and her only daughter had married John Barnard who
evidently thought little of his father-in-law’s genius.</p>

<p>The tomb has generally been supposed to have been raised by
Gerard Johnson, a tombmaker, entered among the lists of the
Strangers in London in 1593. But I have lately found a lawsuit
which proves that his wife was acting as his widow before 1616.
Therefore, if the <i>name</i> be correct, it must have been not his, but
that of his son, who succeeded him in his business. It is not
quite so clear which of them built Combe’s Monument. John
Combe made his will in January 1612-3, leaving £60 for “a convenient
tomb.” He died on 10th July 1614. There are traditions
that he had been “seeing to” the preparations for his tomb while
he was yet alive. He might have fixed his sculptor, and he might
have secured the elder Gerard Johnson. The tradition concerning
the poet’s satirical suggested epitaph, is the only tradition about
the poet which has a respectable antiquity, being referred to in
a Diary of Travel in 1636, when a lieutenant and two friends,
travelling through some of the county, saw that Shakespeare had
a “neat monument” by that time (the first definite allusion to it).</p>

<p>The <i>material</i> of the monuments is worth nothing. I have seen
a small piece of Combe’s Monument which has been accidentally
broken off, and have been assured on the best of authority that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
Shakespeare’s is the same, as a little piece of the stone at the back
has been left unpainted. It is a peculiarly soft and friable stone
for the purpose, variously described as a “soft bluish grey stone,”
a “loose freestone,” a “soft whitish grey limestone,” with pillars
of marble and ornaments of alabaster.</p>

<p>Given a soft and friable stone, we have to consider probabilities
and possibilities, as well as certainties, in duly estimating the
story of its <i>struggle for existence</i>. Time works against it with
greater odds in his favour than he has in reducing stronger
materials.</p>

<p>It may not be quite irrelevant to note, that there was (“Wheler
Misc.,” i, p. 124) a peculiar list of charges brought against the
Vicar, the Reverend Thomas Wilson, for which “being notorious,”
he was suspended for three months from 5th June 1635. Among
these charges it was stated that he allowed his maids to dry linen
in the chapel, his fowls to roost, his pigs and dogs to couch there,
and his children to play at ball and other sports. He himself was
said to have “walked about the church in the time of divine
service.” In the vestry minutes it is recorded: “The minister’s
study over the bone-house to be repaired.” Now, if the children
also carried their sports and balls to the Church it might account
for many accidents, and the very first items to fall victims to boys
and balls would be the legs of the little alabaster angels above
Shakespeare’s bust.</p>

<p>We have also to remember that every church <i>ran risks</i> during
the civil wars, as they were so frequently used as barracks.</p>

<p>I have found in Add. MS. 28,565, a whole volume of Bills for
Damages by the Parliamentary forces in Stratford 1645, from
private people<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> which are only representative of many others.</p>

<p>In March 1691 the Chancel was repaired, the contributors
being chiefly the descendants of those who had monuments of
their ancestors there. The names of most of these are given, but
there is no record of any descendants or friends of Shakespeare
then, so that it may be supposed the tomb was left in a worse
state of repair than the others. (“Wheler Misc.,” iv, p. 99.)</p>

<p>The very fact of the admiration of visitors was a source of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
danger. Foolishly enthusiastic adorers are known to have chipped
pieces from other monuments elsewhere as personal remembrances,
and it is quite possible they may have done so here. At
any rate, from many combined causes, we have clear testimony
from contemporary records, that by 1746 it was “<i>in great ruin
and decay</i>.” It is idle to attempt to estimate the degree of ruin,
but that it had shocked the sensibilities of the poet’s reverent
adorers, is quite clear. The mere wearing off of <i>paint</i> could not
have done so, <i>that</i> rather creates an impression of greater antiquity.
The details of the events are given in the notes, and
their results. One thing must be made clear, that everybody
concerned was <i>giving</i> at that time according to his power. The
Actors gave their performances, the Committee their time and
trouble, the Schoolmaster was honorary secretary, and there were
sundry donations. Therefore a close estimate of the purchasing
power of money at that time cannot be justly made. It is nearly
certain that Mr. John Hall, Limner, and his other unknown
coadjutor, who was to prepare the greatly ruined monument to
receive his painting, would be doing it at the lowest possible
charges. So the amount of work put into the job would probably
far exceed the ordinary cost price. Mr. Hall was told to “repair
and beautify,” and to let it remain as like as possible to the
original.</p>

<p>Any artist or sculptor could inferentially follow their proceedings.
<i>Suppose</i>, for the time, that Dugdale had been fairly correct.
The first things to have been broken off would be, as I have shown,
the alabaster legs of the ridiculous little cherubs. Their trunks
would probably be pushed farther back to keep them out of
further danger, and would be “restored” in the safer position.
By the natural wear and tear of such a soft and friable stone, the
bust would have <i>lost outline</i>. This had to be made up somehow
to hold the paint, either by skilfully inserted pieces of stone, or by
some plastic material. We know that the tip of the nose, the index
finger, and part of the thumb had been broken off, and probably
many other projections. They had <i>no pattern to go by</i>, except one
evolved from memory, judgment, and imagination. No one alive
could remember back to the days of the unrepaired bust. They
would do their best, they could do no more. Probably the outline
of the moustache had been obliterated, and they moulded one after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
what they thought the best fashion. They would mend the nose,
plump out the hollow cheeks, and fill up the eyes. When they
reached the attire, they would not see the outline clearly, and,
guided by the shoulder ridges, would bring the lines of the doublet
straight down (it needed no farther change to make the cloak
such as it is to-day). They would probably scrape down the cushion
to a more normal level, and, believing that a pen should have
been held between the broken finger and thumb, would put
one there. Thus there would be a good many little repairs
made, as in a <i>lining to the coat</i> of paint. But the result would
necessarily be very different from the original.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may not be irrelevant here to refer to a paper among
the “Wheler Miscellaneous Papers,” ii, f. 39.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> It notes “The
fixtures; the things left in Mr. Talbot’s house at Stratford-on-Avon,
26th September 1758”: “In ye Hall, <i>Shakespeare’s Head</i>.”
“In the other rooms 6 Family Pictures,” “In ye Wildernesse a
Stone-Dyal.”</p>

<p>Now, the family portraits might have been Cloptons or Shakespeares,
but <i>what</i> was “Shakespeare’s Head”? was it the death
mask, a cast of the old Bust, or a model for the new one, then ten
years old? Or was it a Bust made in Shakespeare’s life, from
which the original was designed? I cannot even suggest an idea
about it. But it is significant that it is noted, that in the
following year “doubts arose, perhaps not unworthy of notice,
whether the original monumental bust had any resemblance to
the poet” (see Wivell’s book).</p>

<p>In regard to later vicissitudes of the Bust more is known. It
was only in 1793, forty-four years after the repairing, that Malone
attacked it. It is said that he had it down to examine; it is
certain that he covered up Hall’s painting, by instructing a common
house painter to lay over it a thick coating of common white
paint. John Britton, F.S.A., writes in 1849: “In Dec. 1814
I incited Mr. George Bullock to make a cast of the monumental
bust” ... “through the influence of Dr. Bell Wheler, and the
Vicar, Dr. Davenport, he was allowed to take a model”.... “He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
was much alarmed on taking down the Effigy to find it to be in
a decayed and dangerous state, and declared that it would be
risking its destruction to remove it again.” Early in the nineteenth
century Abraham Wivell made a most careful examination
of it, and gave his report in his small volume (published in 1827).</p>

<p>A most important step was taken at the Shakespearean Committee
Room, Stratford-upon-Avon, 23rd April 1835, announced
thus: “The Shakesperean Club of Stratford-upon-Avon have long
beheld with regret, the disfigurement of the Bust and Monument
of Shakespeare, and the neglected condition of the interior of the
Chancel which contains that monument and his grave.”</p>

<p>Thereafter was “a new Society formed, for the Renovation and
Restoration of Shakespeare’s Monument and Bust, and of the
Chancel.” Mr. John Britton was Hon. Secretary, and sent out a
prospectus. In it he states: “A small and comparatively trifling
tomb was raised to the memory of Shakespeare, immediately after
his death; but it failed to attract anything like critical or literary
notice until the time of Malone,” of whom he gives his free
opinion, and the anathematizing lines.</p>

<p>The chief ostensible object of the Society was to <i>repair</i> the
monument, also, in order to preserve it, to repair the walls and
roof of Chancel, to remove all whitewash, and to restore the
colours. The subscriptions invited were limited to £1, but
many sent more. The King subscribed £50, the Borough of
Stratford the same. Many sent their subscriptions “only for the
restoration and preservation of the Monument.” “Mr. Lucy, of
Charlecote, for the Chancel £10.” One of the subscribers says
that he had lately “purchased a very fine bust of Shakespeare at
an auction.” Again comes the query—which one was this, was it
Gastrell’s one?</p>

<p>“The cost of restoring Shakespeare’s Monument and the Chancel”
was £1,210, 12s. on that occasion. A Bazaar was held for further
repairs to the church in 1839; other subscriptions came in, and
the whole amount expended amounted to £5,000. Yet they did
not take off the white paint then. Mr. Britton says of the work:
“Had the building been left a few years longer, it would have
ranked among the Classical Monuments of Antiquity.” Mr.
Britton wrote to Mr. Hunt that: “Your builder is dilatory,
inefficient and embarrassing the progress and character of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
Shakespeare works.” Many things can be learned from the
correspondence with Mr. Hunt, now preserved in a separate
volume in the Birthplace.</p>

<p>Again, in 1861, the bust was treated by Mr. Simon Collins, a
picture restorer, “who with a bath of some detergent” removed
the white paint. He found under it sufficient traces of the
restoring colours of John Hall, to reproduce them again on the
old lines. The only person whom I have known to have seen it
in both conditions was Professor David Masson, and he said that
“he had to confess <i>he</i> preferred it <i>white</i>.” Halliwell Phillipps said in
his fourth edition, 1886, “that the 1793 painting was injudicious,
but did not altogether obliterate the semblance of an intellectual
human being, which is more than can be said of the miserable
travesty which now distresses the eye of the pilgrim.” The only
really fresh remarks that have been made on it were by Dr. Keith
(see “Morning Post” and “Birmingham Post,” 10th April 1914),
when he estimated by anthropometric calculation of the shape
and size of the skull, from which branch of the human race the
poet was likely to have descended.</p>

<p>This was all that I had been able to find before this postscript
went to press. Some hard-working student in future may find
more, and give us further reasons for making up our minds.</p>

<p>Fortunately, before I corrected proof, Mr. Dugdale of Merivale
returned from abroad, and kindly allowed me to see the volume
of Sir William Dugdale’s Diary which contained his own special
drawings for the tombs in Warwickshire Churches. Among these
are, as I expected, Shakespeare’s Tomb. It teaches us many
things. Sir William Dugdale was not an <i>artist</i>, but an Antiquary.
He did not attempt to carry over the <i>expression</i> of the human
countenance, even as represented in Stowe, but he was very careful
as to significant details. He works with slow and careful pen-and-ink
touches. Many of the “proofs” of his untrustworthiness
vanish in the study, and a new element in the question is introduced,
the art of the <i>engraver</i>. One of the objections brought
against his rendering was the spelling of “Judicyo” in the engraving.
Dugdale himself, however, renders it “Judicio,” both in his
drawing and in his copy of the epitaph by its side. The monument
is important, the bust has some of the faults of the engraving.
The hands are quite as clumsy, but the cushion on which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
they rest is not nearly so high or so woolly. The face is older
even than that of the engraver, who really improved the <i>expression</i>,
possibly after a personal visit. The moustache falls naturally down.
The face, as Dugdale draws it, is not so far removed from Rowe’s
rendering as might have been expected after “ruin and decay”
had injured the outlines. And I was surprised to find that what
had proved my own stumbling-block, the lines of the cloak, <i>are
drawn by Dugdale as they appear to-day</i>, and the engraver must
have carelessly altered the sartorial effect.</p>

<p>The greatest “<i>proof</i>” of Dugdale’s inexactitude, so triumphantly
brought forward by my opponents, is utterly extinguished by this
volume. The drawing of the Carew Clopton Monument does not
appear in the Diary, which means, that <i>the Clopton family, and not
Dugdale, was responsible for its drawing and its inaccuracies</i>. He
only drew those which had not been sent on to him by the families
whom he had invited to do so. He evidently thought Shakespeare’s
Monument, though not sent on, specially important, and
did it carefully himself. The present Mr. Dugdale thinks, from
its position in the volume, and from some notes in the Diary, that
it therefore was one of the latest of the drawings before the final
publication in 1656. I have to thank him warmly for his help,
which has satisfied somewhat my hunger for truth. These facts,
with due attention to the contemporary letters about the restoration
in 1746-9, given in Note XIII, conclude all I have to say
concerning the Shakespeare Monument.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XIV">XIV<br><span class="small">SIXTEENTH CENTURY LOCKS AND WEIRS ON
THE THAMES</span></h2></div>


<p>The use of steam, steel, and electricity has changed
not only the methods of travelling, but the appearance
of the highways of the country. The facilities of
transit have enormously multiplied the number of travellers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
and the quantities of goods consigned. We have
been taught to picture the difference between the railroad
of to-day and the highway of the sixteenth century—deficient
in construction and beset by highwaymen, who
lay in wait (as spiders watch for flies) for the saddle horses,
pack horses, and lumbering cars and carriages of the time.
Sometimes the difficulties of the road were artfully made
or increased, so as to bring the prey more easily within
reach of the spiders.</p>

<p>But there has been little or no attention paid to the
changes on another highway—a Queen’s highway, under
Elizabeth as well as Victoria—I mean the royal river of
Thames. I started on the subject years ago, because I
thought it more than likely that Shakespeare had travelled
between Oxford and London by water, and I desired to
understand the appearance the river would present in
“Shakespeare’s England.” Harrison does not speak of it,
nor do novelists romance of it. The passage would not be
made in the light skiffs that to-day lend themselves to the
picturesque and ideal, in quite dream-like motion through
an Arcadian land, apart from the hurry and scurry of
everyday life, where all seems peace and joy, and the only
modern representative of the old dragon is the snorting
steam-yacht that churns the water. Not such a Thames
could Shakespeare see, not such a passage could Shakespeare
know—but a descent in heavily-laden barges on a
busy stream, more cumbered with dangerous locks and
weirs than it is to-day, at each of which was a struggle for
life and property, and probably a battle with the lock
keepers “who sold water.”</p>

<p>From the earliest recorded times there had been a war
waged on the waters of the Thames between landed and
vested or local interests and travelling or commercial requirements.
One of the clauses of Magna Charta determined
“that all locks and wears should be utterly pulled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
down,” a clause expanded and enforced by every succeeding
sovereign who confirmed Magna Charta (see M. C. Hen. III,
c. 23; 25 Ed. III, st. iii, c. 4; 45 Ed. III, c. 2. In 21
Ric. II, c. 19, there is a recital of the Act of 25 Ed. III, st.
iii, c. 4).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Commons shewing by their petition that the passage of
boats in the Rivers, and also Meadows, Pastures, and Arable
Lands adjoining the said Rivers be greatly troubled, drowned,
wasted, and destroyed by the outrageous inhansing and straitening
of Wears, Mills, Stanks, and Kiddles of old Time made, and
levied before the time of the said King Edward, son to King
Henry, whereof great damages and losses have oftentimes happened
to the people of the Realm, and daily shall happen if
remedy thereof be not provided: It is accorded and stablished,
by the Assent aforesaid, that the said Statutes in all their articles
shall be firmly holden and kept, and also duly executed.</p>
</div>

<p>The statute also provided that, if any freeholder had an
old weir erected before King Edward’s time, and the Commissioners
of the Thames desired him to improve it, he
should do it at his own cost. No new ones were to be built
and no old ones enlarged. This was confirmed 1 Hen. IV,
c. 12; enforced 4 Hen. IV, c. 11, with new reference to the
destruction of young fish; confirmed in 1 Hen. V, and in
2 Hen. VI, c. 12. “Because of much mischief done in destruction
of people, ships, merchandise, fry of fish in the
river of Thames without the bounds of London.” In 12
Ed. IV, c. 7, and 14 Ed. IV, the statutes again were confirmed
against “Wears, Fishgarths, Kidels, &amp;c., by Thamys,”
which were reconfirmed in 11 Hen. VII. But it may be
noticed that the statutes did not affect those weirs privileged
by ancient rights or by royal possession. For
instance, in the “History of Oxford,” by William Henry
Turner (p. 54), there is given the Act 17 Hen. VIII
(25 Sept.) for the regulating of the flood-gates, etc., of the
City Mills; and in the June of 1545 “at a council held<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
24th June, 37 Hen. VIII., yt ys agreed that a certen
lokk, lately erected, and called Ruly Myddell Lokk, shall
be stopped upp, so that Mr Doctor Owen and his assignes
shall not drawe the same and torne the water from the
Kynges Mylle of the Cyty of Oxford; and also that all
other sluces and lokks belonging to Ruly shall be stopped
at such tymes as nede shall requyer to cause the water to
have hys right course to the seid mylls,” p. 177. All the
inhabitants were bound to grind their corn at “the Castle
Mills,” p. 179. At the putting down of the monasteries,
Oseney Abbey was leased to William Stumpe, Clothier, of
Malmesbury, and “the Mylles, the Waters, with the fyshyng,
apperteyning to Oseney, with the benefits of the water of
Ruly, to helpe the mylles of Oseney.”</p>

<p>In the Harleian Manuscript, 2084, f. 165, there is a record
of discussions about the mills and weirs of Chester, 1607,
and precedents were brought forward showing how divers
had been “presented” for obstructing the Thames, and
had been acquitted. This shows that in Easter, 3 Hen. IV,
John Shelforde, Lord of Gatehampton, held one lock on the
Thames and one at Rumford, Berks; and the “Priorissa de
Goring” held one weir in the same river. In 5 Hen. IV,
Thomas Camoys narrowed the Thames at Chiselhampton,
and in 6 Hen. IV, Elizabeth, Prioress of Goring, proved
that all her predecessors had a right to a lock on the
Thames.</p>

<p>In Stow’s Survey, Book I, p. 30 (ed. 1598, revised by
Strype), he says of the Thames, that “it is lamentable to
see how it is and hath been choaked of late with lands and
shelves by the penning and wresting of the course of the
water for commodities’ sake”; and at page 39 he speaks of
Bishop’s complaints.</p>

<p>I had found these and several other manuscripts on the
subject in the British Museum, before I turned to Stow.
They seem to be the same that he referred to; but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
originals are so interesting, both to the historian and to the
lover of the river, that, as they have never been reproduced,
I think it would interest all to read the words themselves.
The first “complaint” does not seem to have been preserved,
but the “reply” appears in Lansdowne Manuscript,
XVIII, 62, endorsed “The Reasons of the Mylls, Locks
and Weares to be uppon the River of Thames, 1574.” It
runs thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A declaration of what is to be said and proved for the maytenance
of Mylles, Lockes, and Weares, within the River of Thamys.</p>

<p>Fyrst the said Mylles, Locks, and Weres were erected and made,
and so have contynewed for manye hundred yeres beyonde the
memorye of anie man nowe livinge, without any challendge or
interrupcion. The Lawes and Statutes of this Reallme, whereof
the last was made in the XIIth yere of Edward the Fowerth that
towcht the Reformacion of Locks and Weares, extends onelie to
such as then were erected, to the disturbance of barges and other
vessells, whereas at that tyme there was no comon passaige for
barges, so farre as Marlowe or Byssham, as it is upon vehement
presumpcion thought. And it is further to be moost manyfestlie
proved that within the memorye of such as be yet liveinge, there
were not above the nomber of fower barges, that passed so ferre
into the Ryver of Thamyse as the said Marlowe or Byssham. And
that such as then so passed were not above half the burden of
such as nowe comonlie passe by the said River, beinge neare
abowte the nomber of three score.</p>

<p>Item, it is most certeyne and true that such inconsiderate
people, and namelie of the said Bargemen as wishe or desier the
decaye or pulling downe of the said Lockes and Weares, desier
therein but their owne greate hindrance, or rather undoinge, considering
that it is most manifestlie to be proved, that without the
said lockes and weares they could not passe. And that many
tymes, and specyallie at lowe waters, they are inforced to desier
the shuttinge of the said Locks to thende to convey water for the
removinge of their barges when they are sett on grownde. And it
is also very certeyne that if the said weares should be pulled
downe there be such quantities of chalke and other rubbyshe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
therein, as that by the losinge thereof, such hills would growe in
many places within the River of Thamyse, as that a small bote in
many places thereof would hardly passe.</p>

<p>Item, that in case the said passaige should be disturbed, yt
should not onelie tende to the greate lett and hindraunce of the
Queenes Maties. provision and of her Highnes Cyttie of London,
but also of divers of her subjects and people.</p>

<p>Item, that the provision for gryndynge of a greate parte of the
Inhabitants corne within the counties of Bucks, Berks, and Oxon,
resteth upon the mylles, that ben scituate and beinge within the
said Ryver, which, without the said Locks and Weares could not
be mainteyned, or grynde anye thinge, which, in case they did
decaye, shoulde tende to be to the greate losse and hindraunce of
the said inhabytaunts, who without the said mylls should be to
seeke where to grynde their corne.</p>

<p>Item, in all the commissions of Sewers, that in anye aige or
tyme have been awarded, theis Mylls, Locks and Weares were
never thought to be within the precyncts of anye Lawes or in
anye respecte meete to be reformed.</p>

<p>Item, that the said Mylles, Lockes and Weares are the inherytaunce
some of the Queenes Highnes, and others of dyvers personaiges,
wherein, if any disorder were, the same is to be reformed
by the ordinarye proceedinge of the Queenes Maties. Lawes and
not otherwise.</p>
</div>

<p>In Lansdowne MS., xxx, 16 and 20, are preserved two
petitions which are entered as if in the same year, but
which can be seen, from slight differences among general
resemblances, not to be exactly contemporary. The one
was probably written by John Bishop, the other certainly
was so. “To Sir William Burleigh, Lord High Treasurer,”
the first complaint is presented of the dangers, and a list
is given of “the holders of the locks and wears, and of the
Keepers of the same, which sell the Queenes Majesties
watter in the same river.”</p>

<p>The number of locks given is twenty-five between
Maidenhead and Abingdon, and the paper is indorsed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
another hand “Sept. 6, 1580.” The second is addressed to
“Sir William Cecill, Lorde High Treasurer,” and more
forcibly brings forward the danger and losses of property
and life of the Queen’s subjects; being signed by “John
Bishop, 1580.” The list varies in number, as there are
thirty-six mentioned; and there are several slight variations
in facts, and many in detail. The parish of each is
given, and the names of the owners have a genealogical
interest. Rea Locke belonged to Harry Merrye, a yeoman
of the Queen’s Chamber; Hedgeworth Wear to Hugh
Cotterell. Marlowe Locke, belonging to Thomas Farmer,
gent., is by all reckoned to be the most dangerous.</p>

<p>Temple Locke belonged to John Brinkys, gent., and
Newe Locke to Mr. Bowde and Mr. Lovelace; Mr. Scroope’s
Locke at Hambledon was “kept by Thomas Bulter, a
seller of water”; Fraunces Stonor, gent., at the Marsh, held
one locke, and Robert Wolley, yeoman, another; Bowney
Weare (Mr. Anthony Elmes), Waregroves Weare, Shiplacke
Weare followed; Sunning Locke, belonging to Mr.
Richard Blunte, was kept by two sellers of water. Then
came Cawsam Locke, Chansey Weare; Mapledurham
Locke, said to belong to Mr. William Blunte in one petition,
and to Mr. Michael Blunt in the other; Whitchurch, to
Harry Knappes in both; Harte Lock, Goringe Lock, and
another, owners unnamed. Cleve Locke was the Earl of
Derby’s; of South Mill Weare the owner is unnamed;
North Stock Weare and Wallingford Lock belonged to
Raphe Pollington, another locke and Benson Locke belonging
to Robert George (one of the keepers being named
Jacob Buishoppe). At Little Witenham, a locke and two
weares, one owned by Edmund Fettiplace, the other by
Mr. William Dunshe; a weare at Long Witenham, belonging
to Widow Sanger; Thomas Trullock’s Lock of Appleforde;
an old, ruinous wear belonging to Clement Dabnet;
two locks and one weare, called Sutton Weare; Collombe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
Weare, belonging to Edward Wilmott, gent.; Abingdon
Locke, “being Mr. William Blackmanne’s Locke”; three
locks, at Newnam, Samford Locke, and “Ifle Lock, being
kept by one Mrs. Pitte.” “Every one of these being most
perillous for all passengers, and the Kepers of every locke
making sale of the water, keping the same severall which
ought to be comon to all her Matⁱᵉˢ subjects, and whereunto
in truth they have noe right.”</p>

<p>The petitioner then goes on to state, and mentions
witnesses ready to prove, that fifteen men had been drowned
within four years, and all their goods lost, and begs his
lordship’s earnest attention to this serious state of affairs.
Neither of these petitions seems to have been very successful.
Local interests had outweighed travelling necessities.</p>

<p>But Bishop was not crushed. He designed a more
elaborate composition on a larger sheet of paper, and addressed
it directly to Queen Elizabeth herself. Believing
in her poetic sympathies, he wrote it in verse, which,
though nearly as bad as it could be, was full of earnest
feeling and a certain original quaintness. He spoke movingly
of the “exceeding loss and spoil” of the goods and
commodities of poor men, of £300 a year spent by them in
buying water, of the “murthers” of Her Majesty’s loving
subjects, and of the sorrows of many woeful widows and
fatherless children. Twenty men had been drowned during
the last seven years. The great wrongs he had seen had
moved his heart to write. He had previously complained
to many and found no remedy, though good laws had been
made by many kings “against the mills, wears, and locks
that doe annoy this worthie streame.” Some men neither
care for laws nor for drowning men, and have no fear of
hell before their eyes. The worst of these is Thomas
Farmer, who is as great a persecutor as Pharaoh. To the
widow of one drowned at his lock he had given, in lieu of
life, the sum of 5s. Another man had been cast into prison<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
by him for complaining, but had been drowned in his lock
at last. Farmer’s Lock at Marlow alone has cost the poor
bargemen a thousand pounds and more. The water falls
so high it often sinks ships and men, and it is a wonder
any escape. Four City aldermen had come to view it, and
Bishop refers to them in proof of his words. He is willing
to die if they be proved false. He had complained four
years or more before to the Lord Treasurer in vain, and
since then seven men had been drowned. For his interference
Farmer had tried to work him mischief, and had
complained of him to his captain, whom he loved much,
but who had apparently dismissed him. Bishop was well
acquainted with the perils of the river. He brings them
before the notice of the Queen because he was her faithful
subject born; and the murder of her people, and loss of
their goods, was her loss. He was sure that if she knew
the truth her merciful heart would find means to help,
and that she would command the Lords that understood
the Laws of Parliament to look into the matter before more
blood was spent.</p>

<p>He then gives a list of the men that had been drowned,
and another of his witnesses. This is signed by him, and is
endorsed 13th October 1585.</p>

<p>I have been able to find out nothing more about Bishop
than what he himself relates. If really <i>born</i> a subject of
Elizabeth’s, as he states, he could not have been more than
twenty-seven years old; he was evidently a bargeman, and
Farmer had undone him by complaining of him to his
“captain.” The lock-keeper at Benson is Jacob Bishop,
and may have been a connection. About Fermor more
may be known. The Archæological Institute of Oxford in
1850 published “The expenses of the Fermor family on
the death of Thomas Fermor or Farmer of Somerton,
County Oxford, who died Aug. 8, 1580.” If he was the
“Pharaoh” above alluded to, there is some discrepancy in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
the dates assigned to the petitions. An official answer
sent up to this petition is preserved in Lansdowne MS.,
xliv, f. 40, but it is in such an imperfect condition that I
could only understand it by collating it with the paper of
1574, already referred to, “Reasons alleged for the maintenance
of the Locks, Wears, etc., on the River Thames,
1584.” They are of as great antiquity as any town or
village; that many of the inhabitants of the villages between
Maidenhead and Oxford would not know where to
grind their corn without them; that the water is preserved
for the passage of barges; that, notwithstanding divers
laws made for the advantage of ships and barges, “yet
were the milles, lockes, and weares never impeached as
things repugnant to lawe or offensive to the Commonwealth
before one <i>Busshop</i> begonne outragious attempt therein.”
That, though they number in all about seventy, they are in
part the Queen’s royal inheritance; that the residue are the
inheritance of others of the subjects of the Queen, having
only a way for the passage of herself and her people
through the said Locks. Touching Marlow Lock, that it
was as well maintained as it had been in any age past.
This lock had been obtained from the Queen in the tenth
year of her reign, and had been as carefully used as it
ever had been, as may be proved by depositions taken
before the Commissioners of Sewers, and preserved in the
Star Chamber. The Causes that the passage of this Lock
has become so much more perilous are, that the Barges
are laden with greater burdens than formerly, sometimes
nearly double. They used to carry eight or ten loads, now
they carry twenty loads; they lade and unlade with little
care; and are often up and down so late and so early that
they cannot see where they are going. “They commonly
observe neyther Sabbath dayes nor other dayes, besides
many evil demeanours too long to narrate”; the number
of barges has increased from ten or twelve to about forty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>The statements of Bishop about the men drowned are
criticized, and opinions brought on the other side. The
accidents were often caused by neglect of the watermen’s
duties, and the lock-keepers often helped them in ways
that could not otherwise be provided for.</p>

<p>Another perplexity not much alluded to in these papers
arose from the fact that, though the bed of the <i>stream</i> was
a highway for the people, the <i>banks</i> belonged to the owners
of the adjoining lands; hence many struggles between the
bargemen and landowners over the use of the towpaths.
In 1605 (3 Jac. I, c. 20) it was decreed that the Lord Chancellor
might appoint commissioners to clear the Thames
so that it might carry barges to Oxford and beyond, cutting
down the banks if necessary. In 21 Jac. I, c. 32, fuller
powers were granted them. They were to make compensation
to owners of land required, and to assess the University
and city of Oxford for reasonable sums; and as the
passage up against the stream made it necessary that the
barges “should be haled up by the strength of men, horses,
winches, engines, &amp;c., that it should be lawful for them to
use the banks” for this purpose, if they did no harm. The
ancient right to tow on the Thames had been brought
forward in a case heard before Lord Chief Justice Popham
as to a similar right upon the river Lea, which was contested
(State Papers, Domestic Series, 1594; see Calendar,
pp. 499-501).</p>

<p>John Taylor, the self-styled “water poet,” a contemporary
of Shakespeare, though writing a little after his
date, published in 1632 “A description of the two famous
Rivers of Thames and Isis ... with all the Flats, Shoales,
Shelves, Sands, Weares, Stops, Rivers, Brooks, &amp;c., as also
a discovery of the Hindrances which doe impeach the passage
of Boats and Barges between the famous University
of Oxford and the City of London.” Taylor commences
by regretting the death of Lord Dorchester, who had determined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
to make the river passable, and then enumerates the
dangers and difficulties in verses and spirit somewhat resembling
those of Bishop’s petition. He refers to “learned
Camden, Speed and Holinshead, and Drayton’s painfull
Poly Olbion,” and then describes his own journey down.
At Sutton Lock they were nearly upset, the water fell with
such violence; after Cullam they ran aground; at Clifden
there were rocks and sands and flats; and everywhere were
shoals and piles. More than once a sunken tree nearly
cleft his barge. Near Goring the party was entertained by
“Master Cotton,” and near Henley by “Judge Whitlocke.”
The river did not want much repair below Staines Bridge,
for that was under the power of the Mayor of London. To
Taylor also Marlow Lock was the worst, though he anathematizes
many others:</p>

<p>Thus John Taylor ends, like John Bishop.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>These old discussions are interesting, not only to the
historian and antiquarian, but to engineers and boating
men of to-day, as they have never been collected, and the
Thames Conservancy have no papers of so old a date.</p>

<p>The old system of “flashing” was probably the method
used in those days at the locks mentioned as dangerous.
The chamber-lock is said to have been invented by
Leonardo da Vinci in 1497, but there is no clear notice of
the date of its introduction into English rivers. The beautiful
mechanical invention of working the sluices lately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
placed at Richmond Lock opens a new era in the river
navigation, and under the Thames Conservators the dangers
of the water are reduced to a minimum. But we must not
forget that, but for the outlet of the railway and the high-road,
and the relief of the heavy traffic carried thereon,
this waterway would present a very different aspect to-day
from that which so often soothes the worried, rests the
weary, and calms the troubled soul.</p>

SONNETS</span></h2></div>


<p>I take it, until proof yields a better date, that Shakespeare
came to London in 1587. We know nothing
definitely about him, until 1592, when Greene’s address to
his fellow actors makes it clear that some time before that
date he must have turned to the stage as a profession, and
must have achieved some degree of success, for Greene bitterly
describes him as “an upstart crow, beautified with
our feathers, that with <i>his tiger’s heart wrapt in a Player’s
hide</i>, supposes he is as well able to bumbast out a blanke
verse as the best of you, and being an absolute Johannes
factotum, is in his own conceit, the only Shakescene in a
countrie.”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>When Shakespeare had come to London he had found
theatres built, players performing, and dramatists writing
for them, Lyly, Peele, Lodge, Greene, and Marlowe, who,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
had Shakespeare never come, would have been the greatest
of all. But Shakespeare did come, and developed the perfect
flower and fruit of the English Romantic Drama.</p>

<p>This remark would have been irrelevant to the subject in
hand, but that I hold that the poet bore the same relation
to the sonnet that he did to the Drama.</p>

<p>The Sonnet was not, as the Drama was, of native growth;
it had been imported from Italy early in the century by the
Earl of Surrey and his friend, Sir Thomas Wyat. They did
not closely adhere to their Italian models, but varied them
somewhat to suit the English language and taste. They
had a group of courtly imitators, and various miscellanies
appeared of verses, often but loosely called “sonnets,”
poems written to be said or sung, which we now would
rather call lyrics.</p>

<p>There were “The Court of Venus,”<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> much reprobated by
serious writers, no copy of which has come down to us,
“The Newe Court of Venus,”<a id="FNanchor_32a" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> which seems to have been an
attempt to improve the old songs in tone, while adhering
to their form, some of the verses having been written by
Sir Thomas Wyat himself; “The Book of Songs and Sonnets,”
1557, or “Tottell’s Miscellany,” a collection chiefly
of poems written by Wyat and Surrey, but also including
some of the works of their imitators. We know that
Shakespeare had read this volume, because he gave a copy
to Slender (“Merry Wives,” i, 1).</p>

<p>It is interesting to know that Van der Noodt published
a series, avowedly translated from the sonnets of Petrarch
and Du Bellay, a translation of which, into English, in
blank verse, was produced by Spenser in 1569, which were
included in his works in 1591. Spenser’s “Shepherd’s Kalendar”
came out in 1572.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>
<p>The most important later miscellany was “The Paradise
of Dainty Devises,” 1576, which we also may be sure that
Shakespeare had read.</p>

<p>The harbinger of the new harvest of Elizabethan Sonnet
Literature was Thomas Watson, who, in 1582, published
his “Hecatompathia, or the Passionate Century of Love.”
Two points may be noted concerning this: (1) That he
named each sonnet a “Passion,” which explains Shakespeare’s
use of the word in the phrase, “The Master-mistress
of my passion;”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> (2) that W. C., in his “Polimanteia,”
1595, in a marginal reference, not very clear in its bearing,
said, “All praiseworthy Lucrecia, sweet Shakespeare, wanton
Adonis, Watson’s heir.”</p>

<p>Puttenham’s “Art of English Poetry” was printed by
Field, 1589. The first three books of Spenser’s “Faerie
Queene” appeared in 1590, and Sir Philip Sidney’s “Arcadia”
in the same year, which, quite as much as any sonnets,
affected the thought of Shakespeare’s early works.</p>

<p>In 1591 was published Sidney’s “Astrophel and Stella,”
with some of Daniel’s Sonnets, and in 1592 Daniel published
a collection of “Sonnets to Delia,” after French
models, dedicated to Sidney’s sister, the Countess of Pembroke.
At the same time Henry Constable brought out
“Diana: the Praises of his Mistress in certain Sonnets,”
and “Four Letters and certain Sonnets” were published by
Gabriel Harvey, the friend of Spenser.</p>

<p>Here I must pause, having reached the time of Shakespeare’s
proved association with the Stage, in order to trace
his career up to that date in his private life, and make
clear my reasons for my main proposition concerning the
necessarily early date of the Sonnets. Starting with Shakespeare’s
arrival in London we must remember that the
traditions concerning his being driven from Stratford by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
Thomas Lucy or by anybody else, can be disproved by fact
and legitimate inference.</p>

<p>The only two facts we are sure of are, that he had married
a wife and had a family before he was able to support
them; and that neither his father nor he was in financial
prosperity. His mother’s inheritance of Asbies, which, it is
clear, his father meant as the sphere of his son’s career, had
been lost through a mortgage and some juggling on the
part of Edmund Lambert. In 1587 the Shakespeares, in
despair of regaining it, had offered to sell it outright to
John Lambert for another £20, and to this the poet, then
of age and the heir apparent, had agreed, but that the
money had never been paid is clear from later litigation.</p>

<p>We cannot <i>prove</i> to the sceptical anything concerning
the poet for the next five years. But as Tennyson’s lover
says of Maud,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I know the way she went</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Home with her maiden posy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For her feet have touched the meadows</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And have left the daisies rosy:</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">a student may, with the fine sense acquired by patient
loving study, read signs into known facts as clearly as that
of Tennyson, that the morning daisies and buds when trodden
on, lay their crimson under petals to the side, and the
path is <i>really made rosy</i>. Our poet’s path may be traced in
printer’s ink.</p>

<p>I believe that Shakespeare went to London in 1587 hoping
to earn his fortune there, but that his plans were somewhat
guided by business concerning this desired arrangement
with John Lambert. There is little doubt he would
first go to take counsel with Richard Field, the apprentice,
who was about to become the son-in-law and successor of
Thomas Vautrollier the great French printer. But the
following morning, when he started on his mission, I venture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
to put forward a suggestion that his footsteps took a
very different direction from what has usually been accepted;
indeed, that Shakespeare began by seeking his
fortune not at the play-house, but at the Court!</p>

<p>I find that a John Lambert, possibly the poet’s cousin,
was a Yeoman of the Chamber at the time, and young
Shakespeare might have hoped to persuade him to agree to
the payment of that extra £20, or make up for it in Court
influence. Why not? John Arden of Park Hall had been
Esquire of the Body to Henry VII, his younger brother
Robert, Yeoman of the Chamber to Henry VII and
Henry VIII, his nephew or relative William held the
same office to Queen Elizabeth down to 1584, and his son
Robert was associated with him; John Scarlet, so friendly
with the Ardens of Wilmcote, had been also Yeoman of
the Chamber; Roger Shakespeare had held the same office
in the reign of Mary, and Thomas Shakespeare was the
Royal Messenger, at least down to 1575, possibly later.
William Shakespeare was a man of good appearance and
of manly courage, the two essentials for the post; he may
have had many introductions, and evidently had high
hopes. But he failed. We may realize his feelings during
his first months in London by his works. It was not Hamlet,
Prince of Denmark, who had learned by personal experience:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Who would bear the whips and scorns of time,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">... the law’s delay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The insolence of office, and the spurns,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That patient merit of the unworthy takes.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The country was then stirred to its heart by the threatened
Spanish invasion; gentlemen all over the country
served in the ranks; it is possible that Shakespeare either
served on board a ship or in the army at Tilbury, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
the Queen herself went to address. If he did, he would be
among the disbanded men in 1588, still seeking a post.
There were men of lower rank he was almost sure to know;
Sadler and Quiney, the grocers in Bucklersbury; John
Shakespeare, the bit-maker of St. Martin in the Fields (not
the later John of St. Clement Danes); Mathew Shakespeare,
the goldsmith, who had married the sister of George
Peele, the dramatist. With none of these did he seem to
associate himself. But we have testimony that he did associate
himself very freely with Richard Field. We see the
suggestions of the books printed by him on many a page
of Shakespeare’s works, and reading through the signs of
his familiarity with the printer’s art we may well believe
that he tried to give some return for hospitality by helping
Field as much as he <i>dared</i> do. There was a limit, for the
Stationers’ Company was very jealous of unapprenticed
workmen, and fined Richard Field for keeping one. But
there was nothing to prevent Shakespeare from helping in
reading and correcting proof, and in 1589 Field brought
out Puttenham’s “Art of English Poetry,” a liberal education
to a would-be writer. Other special works were on
Field’s shelves. A new edition of “Ovid,” Sir Thomas
North’s translation of “Plutarch’s Lives,” “Salust du Bartas,”
books on Music, Medicine, History, and Philosophy, which
we can also see reflected in Shakespeare’s works. I could
never satisfy myself with a natural reason for the inter-weaving
of Giordano Bruno’s thought into the sonnets
until I found that Vautrollier had printed his works, which
were condemned, and he himself had to fly the country on
account of them, flying, however, no further than Scotland,
where the King welcomed him, and let him print his own
new book “The essayes of a prentis, in the divine Art of
Poesy.”</p>

<p>From the beginning of Shakespeare’s career he must
have earned the epithet applied to him later by a fellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
dramatist, Webster, who, in the introduction to Vittoria
Corambona, spoke of “The right happy and copious <i>industry</i>
of Master Shakespeare.”</p>

<p>He was preparing for a patron by the time he found
one, but he had been forced, through the stress of circumstances,
to take advantage of the only opportunity
which had been opened to him, that is, on the stage, where
his handsome figure would recommend him, and he probably
had some influence through Warwickshire acquaintances.
But it would take three years at least for any one
to acquire the position outlined by Greene, so we may suppose
that he entered the theatre as a “servitor” or apprentice
in or about 1589. His work must have, at first,
been hard, as he had to be trained, and from the Sonnets
it was evidently distasteful.</p>

<p>The consideration of all the various opinions on, and
interpretations of, the Sonnets would necessitate more
space than can at present be given. Writers have differed
widely concerning their autobiographical value, and those
who do believe them to be autobiographical, disagree concerning
the identity of the persons addressed, of the rival
poets, and of Mr. W. H.</p>

<p>I believe that the Sonnets are a source of some authority,
both biographical and autobiographical, but that they cannot
be interpreted in crude realism. Shakespeare was not
a prose diarist of the twentieth century, but a poet on the
rising high tide of the most creative period of English
literature, in the first fervours of poetic inspiration and
romantic personal affection. After a period of trial, during
which he had been agonizing in order to live and to support
the lives of those that were dear to him, he had met
some one who had the supreme inspiration to encourage
and to help him in the way he needed.</p>

<p>Many of the allusions to conversations, common experiences,
and common studies, are lost to the readers of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
later days, but some of the links of association may be
restored by careful comparison. Sometimes the poet was
only treating a common theme in hackneyed phrases, sometimes
he was only transmuting current philosophy into
verse, But sometimes he was trying to express feelings that
lay too deep for words; his love and gratitude occasionally
led him to impulsive exaggerations, his susceptibility
to hasty misunderstandings. He knew how “to tear a
passion to tatters, to very rags,” when his thoughts hurtled
against each other from their very abundance and exuberance.
But the twined threads of biography and autobiography
are there, on which to string the pearls of Shakespeare’s
thought. These threads can only be wound round
the neck of Henry, the third Earl of Southampton.</p>

<p>No wrong has ever been done to Shakespeare’s memory
so great as the publication of what has been called “the
Herbert-Fitton theory.” The only cure for this, as for any
other heresy, is <i>more study</i>, patient, unprejudiced, wide-reaching,
long-enduring study, not only in the direct
biography of the two men, but in contemporary life,
thought, and literature. The theory was only possible to a
real worker like Mr. Tylor, because he neglected the
Baconian scientific advice, “to search after negatives.” He
only attended to facts that seemed to support his hypothesis,
and turned from those that opposed it, even when
laid before him. Yet he has found followers numerous
enough and important enough to be combated because
they blind the multitude to other truths.</p>

<p>The Herbert-Fitton theory assumes that the Sonnets
must have been written after the arrival of Lord Herbert at
Court. This was in the spring of 1598, he being then eighteen
years old. We are asked to imagine therefore that Shakespeare
instantly was introduced to him, immediately began
to write quatorzains, or disingenuously pretended to do so
for the <i>first time</i> at this late date in the sonnet-harvest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
ascribing to the newly-arrived Lord Herbert, not only inspiration,
but <i>education out of rude ignorance</i>, and the guidance
of his <i>pupil-pen</i>, <i>after</i> he had written, not only both of
his poems, but his “Midsummer Night’s Dream,” “Romeo
and Juliet,” “The Merchant of Venice,” many other plays,
and some of the Sonnets themselves in other plays.</p>

<p>It presumes that he must have warmed up, for this inexperienced
young lord, not only the same feelings that he
had formerly expressed for another, but the same <i>phrases</i>
that he had already <i>published</i>. The whole beauty of “<i>the
passion</i>” dies out before the supposition. We cannot read
the Sonnets as hackneyed imitations of past fashions.
They have all the <i>verve</i> of a fresh impulse, all the ideal
transport of newly discovered power, all the original treatment
of newly acquired music. Little in the data fits the
supposition. Lord Herbert was <i>not</i> the sole hope of his
great house, having both a father and a brother; he was
<i>not</i> a <i>fair</i> youth, but exceptionally dark; he wore no long
locks, curling “like buds of marjoram”; his breath could
hardly have exhaled the odours of flowers (S. 99), seeing
that a diarist states that his chief comfort was in the use
of <i>tobacco</i>.</p>

<p>The lady with whom he was associated has been proved,
on the other hand, to have been, <i>not</i> dark, but fair, <i>not</i>
married and old in the world’s ways, but a bright young
foolish girl of twenty-two, a favourite of the Queen and the
Court, over-impulsive and credulous certainly, and probably
vain and ambitious. But it was one thing, in the lax customs
of the times, to became entangled with the handsomest
and richest young bachelor of the Court, under the
evident expectation of matrimony, and another to have
risked her good name in going forth to tempt, with
experienced wiles, in her even earlier years, the somewhat
well-balanced heart of a middle-aged play-actor and
moralist. What the propounders of this theory make of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
Shakespeare’s manliness or morality it is hard to say. An
unwarrantable stain has been thrown on the girl’s character
because Will Kemp, one of Shakespeare’s company in
1600, dedicated to her his “Nine Days Dance to Norwich.”
But his lack of the supposed intimacy is shown on the
title-page by the error even in her Christian name. The
dedication was quite a natural one from the best dancer on
the stage to the best dancer at Court. In the famous
“Masque of the Nine Muses,” performed at Court at the
marriage of “<i>the other Lord Herbert</i>,” “Mistress Fitton
led, and went to the Queen, and wooed her to daunce.
Her Majestie asked her what she was? ‘Affection!’ she
said. ‘Affection?’ said the Queen, ‘Affection is false.’
Yet her Majestie rose and dawnced” (“Sydney Papers,”
23rd June 1600). Now I believe she should have said “Terpsichore,”
which would account for both the Queen’s remark
and Kemp’s dedication.</p>

<p>We are asked to believe that all the three-years story of
the Sonnets had happened, and that Meres had had time
to complete his notices of Shakespeare based on them, and
get his book passed by the censor, and registered, <i>within
six months</i>!</p>

<p>Finally, this theory pre-supposes that Thomas Thorpe,
in 1609, would, upon the sole ground of two common
initials, have taken the unwarrantable liberty of addressing
in such familiar terms as “Mr. W. H.” the chief nobleman
of the land, who, being the eldest son of an earl, had, from
birth and baptism been designated Lord Herbert. Thorpe
would not have been so short-sighted. That he was not
so, can be proved from his dedications of Healey’s books<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
to the same nobleman in 1610 and 1616. The latter I
found among Mr. W. C. Hazlitt’s “Prologues,” and first
published it <i>in extenso</i> in relation to this controversy in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
“Shakespeare Jahrbuch,” Berlin, 1890, to show how Thorpe
really dedicated, “out of what frenzy one of my meannesse
hath presumed to commit this Sacrilege.”</p>

<p>No, Pembroke was impossible!</p>

<p>In Shakespeare’s poems, dedications, and sonnets the
songs and praises were—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">To one, of one, still such and even so.—S. 105.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">and that <i>one</i> was the Earl of Southampton.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> His life and
character alone provide all the essential desiderata; his
dates alone fit into the chronology of the sonnet sequences
and give Shakespeare his natural place in the history of
literary development; his life alone gives a natural and
unstrained account of “Mr. W. H.”</p>

<p>We do not know the exact circumstances under which
Shakespeare met the Earl of Southampton.</p>

<p>Probably the young noble, in an outburst of sympathetic
admiration and gratuitous criticism, greeted him with easy
patronage on the stage, said to him, “You ought to learn
to write poetry for yourself, come, and I will show you
how,” took him home, gave him some more or less good
advice on accent, manner, dress, law, literature, versification,
and courtly tastes, for which posterity is grateful to
him. Kind offices, on the one hand, were responded to by
gratitude and adulation on the other. Hardly had Shakespeare
been introduced to the Earl than he was made
acquainted with the skeleton in the closet. To understand
this we must turn to the fortunes of Southampton, or
rather, in the first place, to those of his mother. For he was
essentially “his mother’s boy,” though no critics have followed
out her career in relation to Shakespeare’s environment.
She was the daughter of Anthony Browne, Viscount
Montague, and Jane, daughter of the Earl of Sussex. Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
grandfather, Sir Anthony Browne, was considered the
handsomest man in the country in Henry VIII’s time, and
all the family were noted for personal beauty. She inherited
a goodly share, as may be seen by her portrait,
taken in 1565, at the age of thirteen, when she married
Henry, second Earl of Southampton. This is now in the
possession of the Duke of Portland at Welbeck.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> It probably
hung on the wall of Southampton’s home in Holborn when
Shakespeare sung:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou art thy mother’s glass, and she in thee</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Calls back the lovely April of her prime.—S. 3.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Her elder son had died before his father, her second,
Henry, had become sole heir to his great house when he
was eight years old. He seems to have inherited, not only
her beauty and her natural tints, as may be seen by his fine
portrait also preserved at Welbeck, but to have resembled
her in her characteristics. Cultured in taste, with a strong
appreciation of humour, refined in sentiment, religious in
spirit, she was generally able to control the self-will of her
temper by a strong sense of duty, though sometimes her
hasty impulsiveness verged almost on imprudence; faithful
and self-forgetting in her affections, yet, through her very
sensitiveness, easily offended; Mary, Countess of Southampton,
does not seem to have been very happy in her
marriage. Her somewhat severe husband had conceived
some unjust cause of jealousy against her after his temper
had been soured by his imprisonment in the Tower for
the matter of the Duke of Norfolk and Mary Stuart. She
wrote to her father on 21st March 1580, “My Lord sent me
word it was not his intention to keep me prisoner, only he
barred me of his board and presence ... neither could I
take that but in the highest degree of imprisonment, howsoever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
it pleased him otherwise to esteem it.... I sent what
I wrote <i>by my little boye</i>, but his heart was too great to
bestow reading on it, coming from me.” Possibly his misunderstanding
was the precursor of illness, for he died the
following year (1581). He left her as bare as he could, and
she wrote to the Earl of Leicester, entreating his kind
offices on behalf of herself and her children, Henry and
Mary. (These letters are among the MSS. of Cottrel
Dormer, Esq., but being evidently misdated in the second
appendix to “Rep. of Roy. Hist. Com.,” I applied to the
present owner, who kindly allowed me to see them.) Her
son became, of course, a royal ward, and he and his great
possessions were put under the supervision of Lord Burghley.
Camden warmly praises Southampton, and says “he
spent his young years in the study of learning and good
letters, and afterwards confirmed that study with travel
and foreign observation.”</p>

<p>In December 1585 he was admitted to St. John’s
College, Cambridge, where he became M.A., 6th June 1589,
and was incorporated of Oxford. Before leaving College
he enrolled himself a member of Gray’s Inn, 1587, where
he seems to have studied as creditably as he had done at
Cambridge.</p>

<p>But domestic trouble was rising. Burghley was impressed
with the engaging personality, as well as the extensive possessions
of young Henry Wriothesley, and, backed by a
guardian’s privilege, wanted to secure him for his granddaughter,
Lady Elizabeth Vere, the daughter of the Earl
of Oxford. The young Earl seems to have become, under
the persuasions of his mother and grandfather, to some
extent, engaged. It was a suitable marriage in every way,
had but the young people loved each other.</p>

<p>The poor Countess had been handicapped in the battle
of life, because her husband’s family and her own, as well
as she herself, had persisted in the expensive indulgence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
of exercising the rites of the Catholic religion. She well
knew the enormous advantage it would be to the family to
be known to be “connected with my Lord Burghley,” the
“searchings” and “fines” it would help her to evade, the
public offices it would secure to her son.</p>

<p>She urged him to complete the arrangements, his grandfather
urged him, too. Perhaps, because of the very urging,
the burden of matrimonial responsibilities became more
and more distasteful. Dreams of military glory under his
admired Earl of Essex disturbed his studies in old Gray’s
Inn. Burghley began to make inquiries. He could not
understand how any young man in his senses could refuse
such a splendid offer, or even hesitate in accepting it. He
suspected interlopers. He fancied that Sir Thomas Stanhope
might be trying to win him for his daughter; but that gentleman
wrote a long and very full explanatory letter to Burghley
on 10th July 1590, clearing himself of any such treacherous
presumption.</p>

<p>The Countess had, it is true, gone with her son to see
Mr. Harvey, who lived next door, and he had asked them
to sup with him, that was all. Lady Southampton had told
him “She knew what a stay you would be to him and to
her ... in good fayth she would do her best in the cause....
She did not find a disposition in her son to be tied as
yet; what will be hereafter time shall try, and no want
shall be found on her behalf.” Burghley seems next to have
consulted Viscount Montague, who replied on 19th September
1590 from Cowdray that he had “tried as orderly
as he could, first to acquaint his mother, and then himself
with your lordship’s letter, his lordship being with me at
Cowdray....” His daughter had told him that she did
not know of her son’s fancy having changed to any other
maiden, and the youth had replied that “Your lordship
was this last winter well pleased to yield unto him a
further <i>respite</i> of one year to ensure resolution in respect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
of his young years.” I told him that the year was almost
up, and said “that it was natural your lordship should wish
to have the matter about his granddaughter settled.” The
most he could get out of his grandson was a promise that
he would himself carry his answer to Lord Burghley, and
Montague arranged that he and his daughter should take
him to London at the beginning of the term.</p>

<p>On the 6th of October Southampton completed his
seventeenth year. He took, if he did not receive, another
“year’s respite,” and on 2nd March following, 1590-1,
he wrote from Dieppe to the Earl of Essex offering him
the service of his sword. The Earl of Essex had lately
married the widow of Sir Philip Sydney, much to the
Queen’s wrath, and he was in some trouble himself. He
did not risk accepting the offer of the Royal ward.</p>

<p>Southampton was recalled to London, and <i>then</i>, in the
April of 1591, he probably first met, at least as a friend,
that inland-bred actor, who so strangely fascinated him,
and soothed him somewhat in his regret at being forbidden
to follow Lord Essex. Someone suggested to the Countess,
or to the new poet himself on her behalf, that he, a married
man, should try to make the young lord “Suivez raison”
(the family motto of the Brownes). The most likely person
to do so was the stalwart and prudent Mr. William Harvey,
who had won golden opinions from all sorts of people at
the time of the Spanish Armada in 1588, and who was a
devoted friend of the family. If we allow ourselves to
realize the likelihood of this, we find one key to the
mystery of the dedication to the sonnets lying ready to
hand in a place where no one before has looked for it.
(See my article, “Who is Mr. W. H.?” “Athenæum,”
4th August 1900.)</p>

<p>It was held a part of the higher culture, then, to be able
to write verses and to sing them to the lute, and, as such,
doubtless Southampton had essayed to do after the model<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
of Thomas Watson at least, and we have noted what had
been published by that date.</p>

<p>Manuscript copies of the verses of the Earl of Essex,
poured forth when he wanted “to evaporate his feelings in
a sonnet,” would probably also be found in that Holborn
home, when, in that “mutual improvement society for
two,” the principles of literature were discussed. The
young Earl, with his beautiful expressive eyes lit up by
intellectual fire, with his fair face, rich attire, gracious
manners, ingenuous outlook into life and philosophy, and
enthusiastic inclination to help, made a real conquest of
the hungering home-sick heart of the poor player, and such
a love was kindled as had not been sung since the days of
Jonathan and David. It was because Shakespeare could
feel as well as write that he found the sonnet silver and left
it golden. Mr. Wyndham, in his splendid introduction to
the “Poems of Shakespeare,” leaves nothing unsaid concerning
their aesthetic charm. Excepting the first few I do
not think the order of the sonnets at all correct. Some
critics accept the 107th as necessarily the last, and we
know that those to the lady should have been sandwiched
in between those to the youth if the date of production had
been the principle of arrangement. Within the two series
also the order has evidently been disturbed somehow.</p>

<p>We know that they are not all on the same level of
merit; neither do I think them all constructed with the
same “intention.” The last two evidently should come
first, two forms of expressing the same idea from foreign
sources which had probably been read to the poet by the
patron.</p>

<p>Those to the youth were evidently intended to be sent,
and were sent: the earliest ones probably through his
mother. Those to the lady were written, as Goëthe puts
it, “to work off a feeling,” or to shape the expression of “a
passion.” The poet might have <i>sung</i> them to the lady, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
he would not risk the chances of <i>sending them in black and
white</i>. When the feeling had “evaporated” they would be
sent in block to the friend, and thus be kept together, though
possibly multiplied in copies among friends, one of whom
must have proved unfaithful, or Jaggard would not have
secured two by 1599.</p>

<p>It was doubtless with some sense of self-reproach that
Shakespeare, yielding to the family arguments, turned the
engines of his new power upon his patron, urging him to
marry. Training and straining are both too visible in the
admonitory sonnets, which smell of Sidney’s “Arcadia.”
The first seven sonnets, to which I would add the eleventh
and twelfth, make a sequence by themselves. The second
sequence shows deepening affection, freer hand, more
original conceptions. He bids the youth wed to complete
a harmony, to make war with Time, and to do so “<i>for love
of me</i>,” S. 10. Started as a literary experiment they developed
more and more into the expression of personal
feeling, and the advice to matrimony became subordinate,
In the 13th Sonnet the poet first addressed the youth as
“love”; in the 20th and 21st he took him as the inspiration
and his muse.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">A woman’s face with nature’s own hand painted</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hast thou, the master-mistress of my passion.—S. 20.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse.—S. 21.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was something for a poet living lonely in London to
have such a wholesome and safe source of inspiration.
The young noble was vain, and there was a subtle charm
in being thus sung to by one whose genius he thought he
had evoked. He listened more patiently to his poet than
he had done to his mother and friends, but of course the
sonnets had no effect in mending his misogynic mood.
Their writer never expected they would do so, probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
did not even wish it. The first double set of twenty-five
was marked out by a separation which is recorded in
history.</p>

<p>The Queen was to be at Cowdray, Viscount Montague’s
country house, from the 15th until the 22nd of August
1591, and the youth would be summoned to his grandfather’s
assistance. The Queen and Court afterwards went
on to his own house at Tichfield. Special opportunities
would be certain to be made for him on this occasion.
Essex was not at Court, and Sir Fulke Greville and others
were trying to replace him by this friendly rival. Every
young nobleman of the day was trained to act in courtly
devices, and much depended on compliment with Elizabeth.
Shakespeare would very likely have given his “sweet boy”
return lessons in dramatic art, which he is nearly sure to
have tried to display on this important occasion.</p>

<p>During this first period of separation, as Shakespeare
wrote, there had been dawning on him the conception of
a poem, by which he might at once take his position in
the world of letters, honour his friend’s teaching, and in a
somewhat allegorical fashion, after the Spenserian “second
intention,” show how the entreaties of Venus fall unheeded
upon ears intent on other music, and upon hearts filled
with other interests. I do not wish now to go into any
criticism of “Venus and Adonis,” but comparison makes
it clear that the Sonnets were written about the same time,
and addressed to the same person.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Describe Adonis,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and the counterfeit</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is poorly imitated after you!—S. 51.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The work on the poem checked the supply of Sonnets.
Through the next year it developed, a joy apart from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
strains of the miserable time. It was a year quite black
enough to colour all poor grumbling Greene’s bitter spite
against the “Johannes Factotum,” who could both act and
redact plays; a year gloomy enough to tone the picture of
the reverse poem which came insistently into Shakespeare’s
brain to complete his “Venus” conception. For he began
to take two sides to paint his pictures even then, as he
always afterwards did.</p>

<p>Another separation had taken place. In the autumn of
1592 Southampton was in the Queen’s train at Oxford,
acknowledged by all to be the brightest ornament of her
Court. Probably by the end of 1592 Shakespeare sent him
the completed manuscript of his poem, with the private
dedication of the 26th Sonnet, before he began to arrange
about the publication of his “written ambassage,” bidding
him keep it</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">that is by having it printed and bound.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> By 18th April
1593 the Archbishop of Canterbury had licensed it, and
Richard Field had entered it as his copy in the Stationers’
Registers. A more timid prose dedication faced the critical
world. The poet would not shame his friend, nor commit
him to anything, until he knew how the public would receive
him. Then came a surprise doubtless to both of them, and
certainly to others. Adonis leaped at once into popularity!
I noted that before he had completed <i>his first Essay of a
Prentice in the Divine Art of Poesy</i>, Shakespeare had
sketched the outline of the “graver labour,” alluded to in
the Preface to his “Venus and Adonis.” Some of the later
Sonnets seem to be studies for <i>Tarquin</i>, as some of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
earlier had been studies for <i>Adonis</i>. It is worth considering
Sonnet 129 in this light.</p>

<p>The Sonnets had been affected by the appearance of
“Astrophel and Stella” in 1591, and the author was probably
incited by the appearance of Daniel’s “Delia” and
Constable’s “Diana” in 1592 to new variations.</p>

<p>After Southampton’s return to London he seems to have
become interested in other poets, and to have spent some
of the hours hitherto devoted to Shakespeare with other
literary acquaintances. Thence sprang the allusions to the
“alien pens” (S. 87), the “better spirit” (S. 80), the “proud
full sail of his great verse.” Doubtless the chief rival was
Chapman, who even then was doing worthy work. But he
has left no notice of the Earl of Southampton until much
later years. Evidently the young Earl, moved by his poet’s
suffering, had granted that he “<i>was</i> married to his muse,”
and had refused to become the special patron of other
<i>poets</i>. Indeed, he had shown a fit of answering jealousy,
alluded to in Sonnet 109. But all frictions were smoothed
away, and the happy friend and triumphant poet was able
to redeem his promise and to publish his “graver labour”
in May 1594, expressing his love to his patron in nearly
the same terms as he had used in Sonnet 26. His “Lucrece”
assured his position in the literary world and cleared his
character in the eyes of sober men.</p>

<p>I have said that I do not think the order of the sonnets
correct, that the love-sonnets should have been interleaved
with the others, that they had not been sent, and that they
did not mean so much as they seemed to import. Nevertheless,
it seems evident that in the plague year, with all
its depressing influences, in the absence of his friend,
Shakespeare himself had been tempted by a dark-eyed
witch, a married woman, experienced in coquettish wiles.
We do not <i>know</i> who the lady was. I do not think she
was a <i>lady</i> at all in the Court sense of the word. Many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
coincidences support my opinion that she was a rich
citizen’s wife (some of these had been educated by wealthy
fathers to the level of the culture of the time in art and
music); a citizen’s wife who had been married just long
enough to feel a sense of ennui creep into her leisurely
life, and a desire for new conquests to awake in her vain
heart. Such a one he might have met in the very house he
must most have frequented. I do not <i>know</i> anything about
the moral principles of Mrs. Jacquinetta Field, and do not
wish to bring my views as a personal <i>charge</i> against her.
But she fulfilled all the necessary external conditions, and
she was a Frenchwoman, therefore likely to have dark
eyes, a sallow complexion, and that indefinable <i>charm</i> so
much alluded to. Such a woman might very well have
ignored young Shakespeare when he first came, poor
and unknown, about her husband’s house, But when she
found him popular and making his way among the aristocracy
she might suddenly have become interested in him,
and tried to attract him. Other men’s sonnets had taught her
how to act. She tuned her sweetest music to his tastes,
and played remorselessly upon her poet’s heart. After the
publication of “Venus and Adonis” by Richard Field, she
might achieve her desire of meeting Shakespeare’s Earl.
She entangled him for a short time in a game of bagatelle,
in order to torture her victim, though it really seems to
have cured him. And <i>then</i>, it was all over, there was no
treachery, no cruelty, it was all a mistake, <i>a comedy of
errors</i>. The echo of the explanations ring through Shakespeare’s
plays, as well as through his sonnets. A strange
outside reflection of this little domestic drama seems
clearly intended in “Willobie’s Avisa,” registered on
3rd September 1594, in which Shakespeare’s “Lucrece” is
definitely mentioned, and H. W. and W. S. alluded to,
under conditions that strongly suggest the story of the
Sonnets. It shows the picture of a wonderfully admired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
woman of incorruptible chastity, beset by many wooers,
these two among them. “W. S. determined to see whether
it would sort to a happier end for this new actor, H. W.,
then it did for the old player.” Many strange parallels
between the book and the sonnets might be noted, and I
have a shrewd suspicion that the dark lady herself was
a moving spirit in its publication. Personalities were
evidently intended and resented, and the book was “called
in.” But the pain of the publication rankled in Shakespeare’s
heart:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis better to be vile, than vile esteemed.—S. 121.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the same month as Shakespeare brought out his
“Lucrece,” the Countess of Southampton married Sir
Thomas Heneage, a trusted friend of the Queen’s, and
Vice-Chamberlain of the Royal Household. Henceforth
Court patronage was opened to Shakespeare, and during
the following Christmas holidays, for the first time, his
name was entered in the accounts of the Privy Chamber,
as having played before the Queen at Greenwich. Curiously
enough, on the evening of the same day, his company is
recorded to have appeared suddenly amid the confusion of
the Gray’s Inn Revels, and to have performed “The
Comedy of Errors” on the stage designed for graver concerts.
This led to great trouble in Gray’s Inn, and mysterious
investigations, in which an enchanter was blamed.
Nobody asked <i>who paid the players</i>? I have always fancied
Southampton did, and that <i>he</i> introduced them, for how,
without the permission of some fellow of Gray’s Inn, could
they have had access to the stage.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Bacon was employed
to write a device to “restore the honour of Gray’s Inn,”
lost on The Night of Errors.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span></p>
<p>In two ways, both painful to the poet, during the following
year, while Sir Thomas Heneage’s illness absorbed the
attention of the Countess of Southampton, his young
friend’s name had become bandied about among the gossiping
cliques of Paul’s Walk. His friends, Sir Charles
and Henry Danvers, instigated by personal revenge, for
some cause unknown, had, in January 1594-5, taken their
servants and gone out deliberately to murder two men, the
Longs, which they had succeeded in doing. They stalled
their horses in Southampton’s stables at Tichfield that
night, and when they went to London next day he rode
with them and helped them to escape to France. It is
very difficult to understand the meaning of this episode in
his life, for the Danvers remained his friends. The other
was more natural. Southampton, “having passed by the
ambush of young days,” at last fell incurably in love with
the fair Mistress Elizabeth Vernon (the daughter of
Sir John Vernon), cousin of the Earl of Essex, and
Maid of Honour to the Queen. He needed no sonnets
now to urge him to marry, but the Queen forbade the
banns. He hovered round the Court, the “Sydney Papers”
state that he was, in the absence of Essex, “a careful
waiter here, and <i>sede vacanto</i> doth receive favours at her
Majesty’s hands, all this without breach of amity between
them.” But it was the <i>other Elizabeth</i> who drew him
thither. Hasty and impulsive as he was, “My Lord Southampton
doth with too much familiarity court the fair
Mistress Vernon, while his friends, observing the Queen’s
humour towards my Lord of Essex, do what they can to
bring her to favour him, but it is yet in vain,” wrote
Rowland Whyte, 22nd September 1595.</p>

<p>This gossip sunk into Shakespeare’s heart. He knew
that he might be blamed by some, as the Earl’s adviser,
and he called him to task in Sonnets 95 and 96. After
the commencement of this absorbing passion the sonnets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
gradually ceased. Probably Shakespeare realized that his
reign was over. None seem to suggest Southampton’s
voyages, knighthood, marriage, or subsequent imprisonment.
For the allusions in Sonnet 107 must not be confused
with this.</p>

<p>Having interwoven many of the phrases, ideas, and even
situations of the sonnets into his plays, having <i>thrown in</i>
even some of the verses entire, Shakespeare’s fame became
fixed in 1598 by the liberal praise of Francis Meres, Professor
of Rhetoric at Oxford, who noted not only the plays
and the poems, but “the sugred sonnets among his private
friends.”</p>

<p>By some means, pirate Jaggard got possession of two of
these private sonnets, culled those already printed in the
plays, stole many verses from other writers, among them
the “Paris to Helen” and “Helen to Paris” of Thomas
Heywood, and published them in 1599 as “‘The Passionate
Pilgrim,’ by William Shakespeare,” eager to exploit
the value of his name.</p>

<p>To reclaim his own, Heywood published them, as he had
intended, in his “Troia Britannica,” registered before 1609.
Apparently Jaggard published a second edition, probably
in 1609. In the postscript of his “Apology for Actors,”
1612, Heywood complained of Jaggard’s “manifest injury,”
and stated that the reputed author was much offended with
the publisher for “having altogether unknown to him,
presumed to make so bold with his name.”</p>

<p>This is interesting to us, because it is the only recorded
notice of Shakespeare’s opinion of his publishers. Indeed
it is just possible that Shakespeare permitted, if he did not
suggest, the publication of his Sonnets, in order, by showing
all that he laid claim to, at once to punish Jaggard,
and protect Heywood and other injured poets. In spite of
Heywood’s and Shakespeare’s protest, Jaggard brought
out a third edition of the “Passionate Pilgrim” in 1612,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
stating that they were “newly corrected and augmented by
W. Shakespeare. Whereunto is newly added two Epistles,
the first from Paris to Helen, and Helen’s answer back
again to Paris.” But pressure was evidently brought to
bear upon Jaggard, for though this stands in the title-page,
the epistles <i>do not appear in the text</i>.</p>

<p>To whatever cause we owe it, the Sonnets were published
in 1609, long after the vogue of sonneteering had passed,
by T. T., <i>i.e.</i> Thomas Thorpe, with an address to Mr. W. H.
The chief battlefield in the history of the sonnets has been
over the meaning of those initials. I believe, as I have said
above, that they mean Mr. William Harvey.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Heneage had died in 1595, leaving the
Countess of Southampton the second time a widow, in
trouble over his bills, and not over well treated by her
friends. Shortly after her son’s stolen marriage to Elizabeth
Vernon in 1598 she had promised to marry her faithful
friend, now her knight, Sir William Harvey. Her action
roused the indignation of her son at first, and caused discomfort
among her friends. Harvey’s family and position
were not equal to hers, and matrimony in a mother is
sometimes inconvenient to a son. The Earl of Essex himself
took the trouble to counsel her gravely. But like her
son she held her own way through thick and thin, and
married Sir William Harvey that same year. She died in
1607, and it was reported by Chamberlain that “she had
left the best part of her stuff to her son, and the most part
to her husband.” It is very likely that a manuscript copy
of “Shakespeare’s Sonnets” would be left among “the
most part,” and it is quite possible that after consultation
with Southampton and Shakespeare, Harvey, always a
patron of letters, prepared them himself to be published.</p>

<p>Thomas Thorpe was too glad of the chance of becoming
a merchant adventurer on the sea of publication. If, as I
have shown to have been possible, Sir William had, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
first instance, suggested the writing of the early sonnets,
the meaning of Thorpe’s address is clear. It was quite
usual to address a gentleman as “Mr.” after his knighthood.
Lady Southampton always spoke of her second husband
as Mr. Heneage. Further, since the death of his first wife,
in 1607, Sir William had consoled himself with a bright
young bride, Mistress Cordelia Ansley, of Lee. It would
therefore be perfectly consonant with Thorpe’s gratitude
and his character to wish “Mr. W. H. all happinesse, and
that eternitie promised by the everlasting poet.”</p>

<p>The “eternity” intended might have been that of a long
line of descendants to keep up his noble name<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> (for it was
a Thorpe who wrote the address).</p>

<p>It may be urged that I cannot <i>prove</i> this. I acknowledge
it. But surely an explanation so simple and one that fits so
naturally into the whole known series of facts, may be
justly considered and duly treated as a good working
hypothesis, until something better may be discovered.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
And the surest way to learn more of Shakespeare is to
learn more about his friends.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XVI">XVI<br><span class="small">WILLIAM HUNNIS, GENTLEMAN OF THE
CHAPEL ROYAL</span></h2></div>


<p>It has hitherto been a matter of surprise to the students
of Elizabethan literature, that a writer who seemed to
them so commonplace should have held such a high position
in the opinion of his contemporaries as William
Hunnis evidently did. This apparent anomaly set me
seeking for something in the man that did not appear in
his works, or appeared there only suggestively. Every
dictionary that included his name added, “of his life very
little is known.” When I grasped the meaning of his association
with the Kenilworth festivities, I realized that his
life was worth working out in relation to that of Shakespeare.
One thing I have been fortunate enough unexpectedly
to find: the William Hunnis of Elizabeth was
only a survival of the William Hunnis of Mary. Throughout
the earlier reign he was the centre of a group of dissatisfied
subjects, whose souls were stirred within them by
the miseries of their country, and who kept plotting in a
haphazard and disconnected manner until their final discovery
in 1556, when severity silenced them. The Protestant
doctrines and the Protestant spirit of individual independence
could, no doubt, find some means of reconciling
treason to a Catholic sovereign and faithfulness to a distressed
fatherland, crushed under a detested Spanish oppression.
His was a period of unrecognized incongruities.
An imitator of Sir Thomas Wyatt the poet (d. 1542) in his
first literary effort, a metrical translation of the Psalms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
published in 1550, it is evident that he shared in the feelings
of Thomas Wyatt the son about the Spanish marriage,
even if he did not join in his “plot” in 1553-4.</p>

<p>He was a friend of John Rogers, once Prebendary of
St. Paul’s, the co-worker with Tyndale in editing “Matthews’
Bible,” and he had seen his friend burned at Smithfield
on 4th February 1554-5. A few days after he had been
implicated in a plot “to kill the King and after him the
Queen,” while they were witnessing the “Juego de Cañas,”
the Moorish game of throwing cane lances on horseback,
brought over here by the Spaniards, at the wedding festivities
of Lord Strange and the Lady Margaret Clifford.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
Whether the “gentlemen of the Chapel Royal” were to be
among the mounted performers, and thereby veil their
purpose, or whether they expected to take advantage of the
excitement and confusion prevailing, I know not. Nothing
happened. Caution overcame their courage.</p>

<p>It is probable this was the real foundation of the rumour
of what Rapin calls “the forged conspiracy pretended to
be discovered before Philip left” in September 1555.
(Bk. xvi, p. 242, ed. 1733.)</p>

<p>The burning of four Bishops, thirteen clergymen, and
sixty-seven persons this year for religion; the increasing
unpopularity of Philip, his neglect of the Queen and infringement
of his marriage articles; the patriotic dread of
seeing England overrun with Spaniards and its troops and
money drawn into the Spanish wars; all these causes had
combined to deepen the general discontent. Patriotic unity
was even stronger than religious bonds; and a wider conspiracy,
including many Catholics, was formed at the end
of the year, aided by the shifty policy of the French King,
also bitterly anti-Spanish. In January 1555-6 there was a
close meeting of the chief conspirators, to plan how best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
to remove from the treasury the money destined for Philip,
and to use it in a national war against the Spaniards, the
Queen among them. One of their number, John Dethicke
of Westminster, proposed they should invite to join them
“William Hunnis, a very handsome man.” Thomas Whyte,
“he who afterwards betrayed them,” made a difficulty
about admitting a stranger to their secrets, “for fear of
disclosing” (doubtless the others already knew his name),
and then John Dethicke answered Whyte, “We shoulde
not nede to dowt this man, because before at the Jugo de
Cano or Barryers, he, Allday, Cornwalle and others to the
number of twelve, were appointed to have slayen the
Queen’s Majestie, and after that the King’s Majestie.”
Being asked how this took not effect, he said: “There was
such a cowardness and fear in their stomachs when they
sholde have done it, that they made scrupulnes who sholde
begynne—knowing that whoever should have been ruler
afterwards would have been bound to have made an
example of them.” This at least proved William’s inclination
to action (tempered though it was with prudence), and
prepared the conspirators to welcome him. But the matter
was clinched by Dethicke’s telling them that Hunnis had
<i>already</i> “been aboute to counterfeit the Keys of Brigham,
and stele away the treasure.” When asked how he could
have come to the handling of them, Dethicke said Hunnis
was very familiar with Nicholas Brigham, the Keeper of
the Treasure House at Westminster, and with his wife.
His special knowledge, skill, and opportunities made him
a valuable acquisition.</p>

<p>Shortly after, in the beginning of February, as Hunnis
himself narrates in his examination, John Dethicke, “understanding
that I had some skyll and practice in the syens
of alchemy, and more, knowing me to be, by means of
certain suites in Ireland, in many men’s dangers, debated
with me in this wise, ‘Mr. Hunnis, I have but small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
acquaintance of you, and that which is, came of my friend,
Mr. Rogers, for whoes sake and yor own, I should be glad
ye should do well ... for I take you to be a constant
young man.’” Thereupon Mr. Dethicke tempted him to
exercise his skill in “coining” in Dieppe Castle, as the
French King had promised £100,000 to aid the conspirators.
Through an amusing series of conversations, in
which the acuteness as well as the caution of Hunnis is
evident, the various plans of the conspirators were explained,
further than the “oath” of Dethicke should have
allowed to a member yet unsworn. “Thereunto,” quod he,
“Beshrew that head. Thou hast a cursed brain, and forasmuch
thou hast so truely gessed, I put thee out of dowte
that same is our intention, for the French Kinge hath
promised our gents on the other syde to ayd them with
shippes and vitalls and ordenance, and all that we shall
require shallbe to ayd them withall.” “This,” quod I,
“doth lyke me very well.” Nevertheless Mr. William Hunnis
very sensibly saw the possible dangers, and desired to
know what friends they were likely to have. Dethicke told
him of some thirty knights, and a great many noblemen,
of Mr. Bethell and Mr. Thomas Whyte, and notably of
Sir Peter Carew, the fellow of Wyatt in his ill-fated
rising. “He is as sure on our syde, as I have you by the
arm.” Suddenly Dethicke recollected himself, and warned
Hunnis that if he disclosed the names and plans he had
now heard, he would soon be despatched by a dagger from
an unknown hand. “Why Sir,” quod I, “what nedeth ye
thus to dowt of me?” “No, fayth,” quod he, “I dowt
thee not, but as friend, I willed wysh thee fyrst to be slaine
so that they might have their enterprise.”</p>

<p>Through further examinations we find that shortly after,
Bethell, preparing a ship by the aid of John Benbow, of
the Chapel Royal, and others, invited Hunnis to “go
a-fishing with him.” Here, too, his humour and acuteness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
seem to have forced Bethell to lay bare the plans of his
department of the conspiracy. “I would be loth to spend
my time in fishing, I would rather go a piracying,” which
remark Bethell seemed to disapprove of. Nevertheless
Hunnis concluded, “I would very faine go with you,
only I shall not be ready so soon.” Another time he asked
Bethell “Do ye here of any news abrod that certen men
should arrive in this land from beyond the seas?” Says he,
“In faith I car not what I hear, but for myself I will be
sure to serve my country truely.” “And howe?” “To
kepe that no stranger shall land!” “Captain, that is well
said!” answered Hunnis. This was at the very beginning
of March, when they met at Fleet Bridge, and the Captain,
having been to buy an ensign, told Hunnis that his boat
was due by this tide at St. Katharine’s, and that he had
harnesses and coats of mail aboard for over 109 men.</p>

<p>Hunnis was also consulted about the transcript of King
Henry’s will made by Henry Peckham for Sir Anthony
Kingston, who believed that this will, properly read, and
also the laws of the realm, would support the plan of the
Western conspirators “to send the Quenes Highness over
the seas to the King, to make the Lady Elizabeth Queen,
and to marry her to the Earl of Devonshire.” Kingston
encouraged them all, saying, “I tell you true that the
Lady Elizabeth is a goodly liberall dame, and nothing so
unthankfull as her sister is, and she taketh this liberality
of her mother, who was one of the bountifullest women,
but you have served the unthankfullest mistress on the
erth, and all she has done, has been agaynst her father,
and her brother, or else to our sweet Lady Elizabeth.”</p>

<p>Allday attempted also to win Roger Carter, one of the
King’s servants at Westminster, saying that Dethicke had
sent him to open matters to him and to tell him that
“Hunnis also was privie to the plot”; but Carter after a
sleepless night had told Allday that he would have nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
to do with it, and willed both Dethicke and Hunnis “to
leave all such practises, or he would turn Displayer.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless they worked on, without telling him any
more.</p>

<p>Constant communications went on with Henry Dudley,
the Ashtons, and other gentlemen abroad; with the
“Pirates” and the leaders of the movement in the West,
and with the French King, for a convoy. The conspirators
had progressed so far that they had entered the Treasure
House on the 6th of March, and finding the box too heavy
had planned to force it open, and take the treasure in portable
packages through Rossey’s garden to the boat that
would await them on the river by the steps on the 17th
of March. On the 16th they took the final solemn oath
to hold by each other, and John Throgmorton, the real
leader of the London party “said he wished his dagger was
in the Queen’s heart, and in that of her Council.” On the
17th twenty of the chief of them were arrested, and conveyed
to the Tower. I know that Mr. Froude gives it as
the 18th, following Machyn and others. But the “Tower
accounts” of the year contain the expenses for boarding
Throgmorton, Daniell, Peckham and others, and are dated
from the 17th.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> I suppose therefore the arrest took place on
the evening of the 17th, and became known to the people
on the morning of the 18th. The name of Hunnis does not
appear in this bill, but that only proves that he did not pay
for extra diet. His name is given in Machyn’s list under
the spelling Heneges, which Froude misrendered into
Thomas Heneage. His name appears twice on the first
list of conspirators. He was captured about the same time,
and lodged near the others in the Tower; his conversations
upon “prudence” and “purgatory,” spoken through the
walls of cubicles and subdivided cells, are recorded among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
the confessions of Peckham. It must have been a trying
time. The heat of action and the hope of success had died
out of him, the certainty of danger, the dread of torture and of
destruction surrounded him. Four days after his incarceration
he would hear (for jailers then spoke to their prisoners)
of the burning of Cranmer, while one after the other of his
fellow prisoners was tortured. On the 21st of April his
friend and leader, the one brave man among all the batch
of prisoners, John Throgmorton, was tried at Southwark,
along with Uvedale, Governor of the Isle of Wight, and
they were executed together at Tyburn on the 28th. On
the 5th of May, Hunnis himself was arraigned at Guildhall
in company with Henry Peckham, John Daniell,
William Stanton and Edward Turnour; on the 7th Peckham
and Daniell were condemned, and the others afterward.</p>

<p>But Hunnis now disappears from <i>historical</i> notes. Whether
he appealed to any rights on technical points; whether he
owed his life to his being arraigned as “Thomas,” instead
of “William,” or to the unusually difficult writing of the
clerk who took down his depositions; whether his youth,
beauty, popularity, talents, or frank confessions moved the
hearts of his judges; or whether he was <i>remanded</i> through
the interest of his old master the Earl of Pembroke, I
know not. He may have been forgotten as being too <i>insignificant</i>.
For two years he languished, neglected in the
Tower, only to be delivered on the death of Mary. He may
have been released <i>shortly</i> before that date through influence.
That the terrors and discomforts of prison life had
entered into his soul, that fears of rack and execution had
aged his youth, we can see from two sets of verses in “The
Paradise of Dainty devices” (ed. 1596), “Being asked the
occasion of his white head,” No. 4 and No. 93. In the latter,
in feeble verse, and many incomprehensible phrases, he
certainly gives a chapter from his life’s experience, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
asserts his belief in the righteousness of his cause and in
the reward of his faith in God.</p>

<p>Whether the whole period between March 1556 and the
accession of Elizabeth was spent by William Hunnis in
the Tower or not, we are certain he would be freed at once
by the new queen, “his sweet Lady Elizabeth,” and restored
to his “living” as gentleman of the chapel (if he ever had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
been formally deprived of it). Early in the new reign he
passed through great personal sorrow, as well as joys. His
friend Nicholas Brigham did not survive his Queen long.
And his widow, having lost her only child Rachel before
the death of her husband, married William Hunnis. His
predecessor William Crane in the office of Master of the
Children of the Chapel was a married man. Until I learned
the fact, I had not thought the laws, or at least the customs
of the time, would have permitted this. And the marriage
of Hunnis was also surprising, especially in connection with
the gossip of Dethicke, which implied undue familiarity
between Hunnis and Brigham’s wife. Nevertheless the
testimony is irrefragable. On 2nd June 1559, “Margaret
Hunnis, alias Brigham, alias Wariner, wyfe of William
Hunnys, gentleman of the Queene’s Majesties Chappell,”
made her testament nuncupative, in which, by consent of
her husband, she left to her “Cousin Francis Brigham all
that her tenemente and mansion house lyinge and beyinge
at Westminster, commonly cawled ‘The Allmes House,’”<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
founded by Henry VII, and sold by Vincent to Brigham in
34 Hen. VIII. All her other goods, movable and immovable,
she left to her husband, William Hunnis, whom also
she named her executor. This testament was proved by
Thomas Willot for William Hunnis, 12th October 1559.
Her will in Somerset House is strangely involved with that
of her husband, and clears up much.</p>

<p>Chalmers’ “Biographies” and Wood’s “Athenæ Oxonienses”
say that “Nicholas Brigham died in his prime in
December, 1559, at Westminster, leaving some MSS.:
(1) ‘De Venationibus Rerum Memorabilium,’ a collection
of notices of characters and events of which Bale has made
much use; (2) ‘Memoirs,’ in the form of a diary in twelve
books; and (3) ‘Miscellaneous Poems.’ None of these is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
probably in existence.” Wood thinks he was buried near
Chaucer, whose tomb he had restored in 1556. But he is in
error in the date; he died in 1558, leaving, by a verbal will,
everything to his wife. She was granted powers of administration
20th February 1558-9, and at least before the
following June, Hunnis had married Brigham’s widow. The
entry among the wills, December 1559, is an objection to
William Hunnis succeeding his wife, widow of Nicholas
Brigham. Considerable litigation ensued in consequence
of her bequests.</p>

<p>The young widower had, however, consoled himself within
two years by marrying again. This time it was Mrs. Blancke
of the Grocers’ Company; through her right Hunnis became
a member of the Grocers’ Company, being admitted as redempcioner
on 11th November 1560. Having found from
the Guildhall records that he was a “Citizen and Grocer”
of London, I made application to the Grocers’ Company,
and was allowed to search their books, where I found many
details unknown before. The authority of Mr. Kingdon
corroborated that evidence. On 9th May 1567, he was
formally admitted to the “Livery and Clothing” of the
company, the fourth among a list of eighteen citizens. He
duly paid his brotherhood money, two shillings. In the
year 1570 his name was entered among the group of those
“dwelling at Westminster and extravagant”; and he paid
four shillings for the brotherhood money for the last two
years, and two shillings towards defraying the expenses of
the election feast. His marriage would be all the more
important to him financially as he had, with other of her
subjects, to wait some time before any practical recognition
of his services was rendered him by Queen Elizabeth, beyond
those connected with his living. The first that I
have found recorded is a patent in June, the fourth year of
Elizabeth, to the office of supervisor and custodian of the
orchards and gardens at Greenwich, called the “great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
gardyne” and the “new gardyne,” to hold during his life
with a salary of 12<i>d.</i> a day and various perquisites.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> One
duty was to present the Queen with seven gallons of “sweet
water” a year. I am aware that Cunningham, in his notes
to his edition of the “Revels Book,” asserts that this is
another William Hunnis; but he had not made a thorough
search, or he would have found it expressly stated that the
grant was to “William Hunnis of the Chapell.” This, therefore,
connects him with various payments made “to the
supervisor of the gardens” for “men gardeners and women
weeders at Greenwich”; and also with the famous account
for seventy-nine bushels of roses and many bushels of other
flowers in June of the 14th Elizabeth, “in preparation of
the Banketing Howse made at White Hall for the entertainment
of the said Duke.” Not only were there to be
wreaths and adornments of flowers, but the floor was to be
strewn with “rose-leaves pickt, and sweetened with sweet
waters,” under the supervision of Hunnis. One suggestive
point in connection with this patent of supervisor I have
not yet worked out; but I may mention that his predecessor
in office was one Philip Innes, whom Edward VI, in the
fourth year of his reign, appointed for life to this post.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> But
in 1562 the said Philip Innes appears before Elizabeth
and “renders up his office in favour of one William
Hunnys,” and his patent is then cancelled. The new patent
is at the side named “the patent of Philip Innes alias
Hunnys,” and this is scratched out, and below is written
fair “the patent of William Hunnys.” Is it possible that
this Innes was his father, and that he had been brought up
as a “gardener’s son”? Had he improved his name into
Hinnes, in which form it appears oftener than in any
other? I cannot yet say more than that the point is worth
noting. In the first year of Mary there was another of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
name, a John Innes, of Westminster, appointed to receive
the “first almsmans room in the cathedral church of Westminster.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth often liked to pay her debts at the expense of
other people. It was through a second grant of hers that I
discovered Hunnis as a “citizen and grocer of the city of
London.” In relation to the entry in Guildhall, which states
in the Records, 30th May 1570, that a “reversion of the
office of collection of the cities rightes, duties, and profittes,
cominge and growinge uppon London Bridge, for wheelage
and passage” was granted “to William Hunnys, citizen and
grocer, and also master of Hir grace’s children of hir Chappell
Royal,” upon letters of her Majesty in his favour.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Various difficulties had arisen from the fact that the
acting collectors had been promised that they should retain
the post, not only for the twenty-one years for which
they held a patent, but for the term of their natural lives
and the life of the survivor, so it was agreed that the bridge-master
should pay to Mr. Hunnis, in gratification of the
Queen’s letters, the sum of £40 for a lease in reversion of
the wheelage and passage of London Bridge.</p>

<p>Whether this £40 was in lieu of the reversion, or only as
a <i>douceur</i> for the time likely to elapse before the reversion
should fall in, is not clear from the passage, and I have not
yet been able to work it out. With his various expenses
among the boys of the Chapel this £40 would not last long.</p>

<p>I do not now notice his poems, because I have only
acquired any knowledge regarding them from printed
material. But it is evident his poems read differently when
connected with the events of his life. For instance, the
opening device at the Kenilworth<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> festivities in 1575, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
Sybilla prophesies good things to Elizabeth, comes gracefully
from one who had conscientiously plotted to make her
queen two years earlier than she became so—probably the
only <i>poet</i> of that conspiracy then surviving. The <i>rewards</i>
for his plays can be found among the declared accounts
of the Treasurer of the Chamber, and his death is noted
in 1597 in “the Cheque Book of the Chapel Royal.”</p>

<p>By the favour of Elizabeth, on the death of Richard
Edwards, Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal, on
the 31st of October 1566, William Hunnis was appointed
in his place on the 15th of November. But Elizabeth
proved in his case not a “liberall dame,” as his perquisites,
or rather his provisions, were materially curtailed, at the
same time that the prices of food had much increased.
This he very clearly explains in an interesting petition
presented to the Council in November 1583,<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> where he states
that he had to keep not only an usher, but a man-servant,
to wait on the boys, and a woman-servant to keep them
clean, on an income of 6<i>d.</i> a day each for their food, and
£40 a year for their apparel and all other expenses,
nothing being allowed for travelling and lodging when the
Court required him to carry the boys with him to various
places. On an examination of his demands, they appear
both just and moderate. We do not wonder that he left
no will, unless the verses written on the fly-leaf of Sir
Thomas More’s works really represented one:<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

I only now allude to it in connection with others that are

<p>I know it is possible that some may object that the
William whose name I find spelt in seventeen different
ways is not the same as the “Thomas Hinnewes” tried
for his life at Guildhall. But the connecting links are
strong.</p>

<p>This laxity of orthography made me look up all resembling
names in wills, inquisitions, etc, about the period, to
find a pedigree for him, but without success as yet. I have
not found the name “Hunnis” appear before his time,
and since then only twice; the first being a Thomas Hunnis,
who died in 1626, and might very well have been his son;
the other a “Marchadine Hunnys, of Berks, Plebs; a Demy
of Magdalene College, Oxford, 1605; M.A. 1610.” This
may give a clue to the local origin of the name, but the
Marchadine “Plebs” could not have been son of William,
as he was always entered “gentleman,” and had a coat of
arms granted him in 1568 different from that printed by
the College of Heralds (Ash. MS. Bodleian Library).</p>

<p>My original materials have been collected from the
Manuscript Department of the British Museum, the Public
Record Office, the Guildhall Record Office, the books of
the Grocers’ Company, and from Somerset House. Only
want of space prevents my giving references in full. I
sincerely hope, however, that I may have an opportunity
of publishing ere long the whole series of papers which I

<p>PS.—This first paper ever printed on Hunnis came out
in time for the D. N. B. In that same year I had all the
patents concerning William Hunnis translated for me, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
order to be exact (I still have the dated bill for the
transaction) in preparation for a Paper which I read before
The New Shakespeare Society in April 1892. Dr. Furnivall
allowed me extra time to read it because my materials
were new. Shortly after I completed my book entitled
“William Hunnis and the Revels of the Chapel Royal,”
which I could not afford to publish, and laid on the shelf
for ten years till Dr. Furnivall recommended it to Professor
Bang for the Louvain Series of “Materials for the History
of the English Drama.” It was sent to him in 1904, but,
by a special stroke of bad luck, was not published until 1910.
The only point I had not secured was found by Professor
Feuillerat too late to be included; as he only published it
on 22nd December 1911 in the “Daily Chronicle.”</p>

<p>This gave the important story of the association of
Hunnis and Farrant with the early venture of the Blackfriars
private theatre in 1576. I had long sought for it; had,
indeed, applied for a ticket for the Loseley Manuscripts
on purpose in 1906, but, as the late owner was abroad in
search of health, my search was postponed. A friend of
the family assured me that there was nothing among the
papers on William Hunnis, but very much about the Earl
of Southampton, so I <i>thought</i> that I could afford to wait.
My only real regret, however, was that Professor Feuillerat
should not have published his find earlier, to allow me to
borrow it (with acknowledgement), to complete the life of
the writer, of whom the reviewer in the “Times” in 1910
said, “Mrs. Stopes has made a <i>man</i> of him.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately the Louvain Series is produced at such
an expensive rate that it finds comparatively few English
purchasers. Some of my new facts have appeared <i>since</i> in
Professor Wallace’s “Evolution of the English Drama.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XVII">XVII<br><span class="small">BURBAGE’S “THEATRE”</span></h2></div>


<p>To few pioneers is it given to initiate, and also to
develope into completeness, any great new form of
national art. Chaucer was not our first poet, Shakespeare
was not our first dramatist. Our first architect, our first
musician, our first painter, would be hard to find. But we
know where to look for our “first builder of playhouses.”</p>

<p>A remarkable man he must have been, strong of physique,
intellect and courage, strenuous, many-sided, imaginative,
far-seeing, irrepressible. A special strain of genius must
have prepared him to face difficulties thrown in his way
during the development of his great Idea.</p>

<p>In all our discussions about the Shakespeare Memorial
and the National Theatre, it would be well to remember
what one man did towards that end 330 years ago.</p>

<p>James Burbage, the joiner by apprenticeship, the player
by inspiration, the manager by sheer superiority, formed
the best company of players of his day, and persuaded the
greatest Earl of the kingdom to secure him the first Royal
Patent to players, a patent which raised them from being
“vagabonds” into artists. With a strategic skill worthy
of a great commander, he circumvented the fettering edicts
of the Common Council by carrying his company outside
their jurisdiction, and, in seeming to obey the regulations
against playing in inn-yards or in open spaces, reared
for himself an edifice in which he could foster and develope
the national drama, an edifice which he had the foresight
to name “The Theatre.” The special and particular name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
he chose has become the generic name or patronymic of all
its descendants. Within the wooden walls of his citadel,
protected by doorkeepers, he had an opportunity, not only
of earning money, but of educating the people, superintending
at the same time a school of actors and a school of
dramatists. To him came the honour of rearing a son
whom he trained to be the greatest tragedian of his day;
to him came the proud satisfaction of finding and training
the provincial player who helped him to make his name;
to him came the appreciative insight into the powers of
this “fellow,” which led him to encourage Shakespeare to
make use of his opportunities of patching and improving
old plays until he could stand alone; to him came the
crowning glory of seeing <i>his man</i> become the greatest
dramatist of his time. And all this was done in about
twenty years! What actor-manager has ever done like
unto him? And all that he did was achieved under the
stress and strain of active opposition from many quarters;
he was constantly being harassed by regulation, legislation,
and litigation with rivals, relatives, and landlords, eager to
share in the profits of his phenomenal financial success
(which, however, through his heavy expenses must have
been much less than they supposed it to be). He was a
pioneer, but he had more than his fair share of fighting
to do. The Curtain “rose like an exhalation” in his wake,
and left no records in its train. His very popularity made
his path more thorny.</p>

<p>It may be well to collect what little is known of him.
Halliwell-Phillips, that industrious writer, discovered many
points, but his reticence, or at least haziness, about references
has prevented his successors from following him to
his originals. He is generally correct in his transcripts,
but not always so; his inferences are sometimes erroneous;
he did not cover the whole possible field, so there are many
fresh references to be brought forward, not, perhaps, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
prime importance, but still important enough to help to
complete “the idea of the life” of James Burbage.</p>

<p>We do not know when or where he was born or educated,
what was the occupation of his father, or when he joined the
Earl of Leicester’s servants. We do know that he was bred
a joiner, and must have been a member of the company, as
he is frequently described as a “joiner,” in his legal actions,
even after one would have thought another description of
him would have been more suitable. But any <i>citizen</i> then,
even in the lesser companies, was reckoned more respectable
than a “<i>player</i>.” Think of his times. On 12th February
1563 Edward, Bishop of London, wrote to advise Sir
William Cecil to inhibit all players, at least for a year, it
would be well if it could be for ever. They spread the plague
and profaned Holy things; “the Histriones, the common
players,” are “an idle sort of people which have been
infamous in all good commonwealths.” In 1572 Queen
Elizabeth enacted the famous statute<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> that “Rogues, Vagabonds
... fencers, Bearwards, Common Players, and Minstrels
not belonging to any baron of the Realm shall be
judged Vagabonds,” and made liable to be whipped and
sent to some respectable service. To satisfy the Queen’s
private tastes, however, and their own, many barons helped
the better class of players by enrolling them as their “servants,”
and thus securing them some ill-defined privileges.
But the City strongly disapproved of plays and players.
On 2nd March 1573-4 the Lord Mayor declined to license
a place in the City, even for the servants of the Earl of
Sussex; on the 22nd the Privy Council asked the Lord
Mayor what cause made him thus restrain plays. Dissatisfied
with his reply, the Earl of Leicester, determined that
his servants should not be put to such an indignity, secured
the first <i>Royal Patent</i> under the Privy Seal for them, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
introduced James Burbage into the history of his country.
As it gave him, on paper, a large liberty, and raised his
craft to the level of an art, often as it has been printed, it
is important to start with it in any history of the stage.
One forgets sometimes. On 7th May 1574 the Royal Patent
warned all officials to permit</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>to James Burbage, John Perkyn, John Laneham, William Johnson,
Robert Wylson and others, servants to our trustie and well-beloved
Cousin and Councillor, the Earl of Leicester, to use,

Tragedies, Interludes, Stage Plaies, and such other, like as they

as well as for the recreacion of our loving subjects as for our
solace and pleasure when we shall think good to see them ...

and that they be not published or shewen in the time of Common
Prayer, or in the time of great and common plague in our said
City of London.</p>
</div>

<p>Nothing could have been more explicit, or more exasperating
to the Corporation of London, than this permission
to contravene their mandates.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> The Corporation’s
counterblast was the famous Order of 6th December 1574.
They threatened fine and imprisonment to any who “played
without a licence from the City each time,” and without
giving half the proceeds to the poor. They did not “tender
the Queen’s pleasure” in respect to the players.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>At the close of 1574, on St. Stephen’s Day, the Earl of
Leicester’s servants played before the Queen at Court, and
opened the year by playing on New Year’s Day, 1574-5.</p>

<p>Other noblemen hastened to request Royal Patents for
their servants. The battle between the Privy Council and
the Common Council raged all the more hotly since the
players had been “patented,” and the climax came when
the Lord Mayor expelled all players from the City, under
an undated “Order for the relief of the Poor” printed by
Singleton.</p>

<p>Leicester’s servants played before the Queen on Innocent’s
Day 1575, and again on the Sunday before Shrovetide.
For the first time they were fully described in the
warrants for payment granted by the Privy Council<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> and
in the declared accounts of the Pipe Office<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> as “Burbage
and his company, servants to the Earl of Leicester.” But
even Leicester’s servants, with a Privy Seal Patent from
the Queen, could not very well live all the year round on
Christmas gifts. They must either go on tour, act in the
City or near it, starve, or turn to another trade. Burbage
did return awhile to his original trade. He had had a prevision
of what was coming, had kept his eyes open, and
had laid his plans, and found a “place where to stand.” A
few months after the expulsion order, on 13th April 1576, he
had signed and sealed an indenture of lease for a parcel of
land of the disused monastery of Holywell, stretching from
the barn and outhouses of the property of the Earl of
Rutland to the brick wall that bounded Finsbury Fields.
It belonged to Giles Alleyn, Arm., and his wife Sara, and
contained a barn, some old tenements, gardens, fields, and
some “voyd ground.” His plans necessitated engineering
and financial skill, credit, and money. James Burbage had
the first, but he was not rich. He had married, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
some time previous to this, Ellen Braynes, who had “expectations.”
Halliwell-Phillips and all his followers say she
was the <i>daughter</i> of John Braynes. But he is in error; the
language of some of the cases he knew might have taught
him better. But a case which he evidently did not know
states clearly that John Braynes was the only brother of
Ellen Burbage. He was evidently, at the time, a childless
husband, as in his lawsuits there is constant reference to
the understanding that his sister’s children would inherit
all he had, seeing he had none of his own. There was an
inn upon Burbage’s leasehold, but players had been forbidden
to play in inn-yards. He could not risk playing on
his “voyd ground,” as his audience might melt away
before they paid the costs, so he resolved to build a <i>playing-house</i>
in his fields. John Braynes, fired with the idea of
making a speedy fortune, agreed to become a sharer in
costs and profits, and each signed a bond to the other.
Giles Alleyn signed the lease, knowing quite well it was to
be for the players, but he did not mind much, as he himself
was going henceforth to live in Essex. He also knew that
Burbage was the “servant” of the Earl of Leicester, and it
was not safe to disoblige that great noble, even through
his servants. Alleyn was used to land-transfers and litigation,
and he thought he made a safe bargain. He did not
want to give a longer lease than twenty-one years until he
saw how playing-houses were likely to do, but he permitted
a clause that if, before the end of the first ten years,
James Burbage had spent £200 in repairing or rebuilding
the old tenements on the property, he could have another
lease from that date of twenty-one years (making in all
thirty-one years), and he could, at the end, carry away the
materials of any building he had erected for himself.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
Burbage was to pay the legal expenses of drawing up and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
the engrossing of this second lease. Of course, there was
some preliminary “consideration,” but the rent seemed
very moderate even for the time, for the extent of land
leased at £14 by the year including the tenements inhabited
by sub-tenants. Burbage, with Braynes’ help, set
to work at once. It is probable he was his own architect,
contractor, and master-builder, that he even used his own
hands in the work, and pressed those of his “unemployed”
company to hasten forward the edifice which promised so
soon to help them in return. Wood does not necessitate so
many difficulties or delays as stone and brick. It can be
fetched from the country prepared, and even partially put
together, as can be learned from one of Peter Street’s lawsuits.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
As the building rose, it became its own advertisement.
Finsbury Field was the City-ground for drill and
archery, the people’s play-ground. From its boundary
crowds watched the rising fabric, eager and impatient as
the owners, and more curious. We may be quite sure that
Burbage’s building was the main topic of London gossip
during 1576. When, protected by walls, doors, and doorkeepers
from impecunious prying eyes, it did open on
some unrecorded day that year, of course there were disturbances.
Everybody wanted to enter the charmed circle
at once, to see the plays from which they had been so long
debarred, and to understand Burbage’s little game. The
humour of the situation tickled the fancy of the people;
the taste of the forbidden tree was sweet to their palate;
cutpurses saw their chance among the genuine play-lovers,
and there was crowding, crushing, struggling for entry,
quarrelling for places, shouting, and all signs of a brawl.
Free fights ensued, and “The Theatre,” from the very first,
through no fault of its owner, became associated with
breaches of the peace, which its enemies made the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
of. In the following year it came into history by name.
On 1st August 1577 the Privy Council, moved by the City,
for fear of the plague, wrote to the Middlesex authorities
to take order with “such as use to play without the Liberties
... as at the Theatre and such like,” to forbear playing
till after Michaelmas.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> A sermon preached at Paul’s
Cross in the time of the plague, 3rd November 1577, by
T. W. (printed 1578) refers to “the sumptuous Theatre
houses, a constant monument of London’s prodigalitie and
folly.”<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> John Northbrook’s “Book against dicing, vaine
playes, or enterludes,” entered in Stationers’ Hall, 2nd December
1577, refers to “the Theatre and the Curtain.” The
Earl of Leicester’s players however played at Court that
Christmas, but again on 17th April 1578 the Privy Council
wrote the Middlesex authorities to restrain players till
after Michaelmas. John Stockwood, Schoolmaster of Tunbridge,
preached a sermon at Paul’s Cross on 24th August
of that year, in which the Theatre and Curtain are both
referred to by name, and again he refers to “the gorgeous
Playing place erected in the fields, as they please to have
it called, a Theatre.”<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> On 24th December 1578 the Earl of
Leicester’s servants had a licence to play in the City,
because they were going to play before the Queen at
Christmas. They played on St. Stephen’s Day, but on
Shrove Tuesday they were paid in full for coming, though
the play, by her Majesty’s command, was supplied by
others.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> This was probably the sign of a tiff with
Leicester.</p>

<p>Burbage’s promptness, sumptuousness, and success could
not be attained without lavish outlay of money, more than
he had himself or that his brother-in-law could command.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
Apparently he found it through John Hyde, grocer, though
no record of the transaction has been preserved otherwise
than the fact that Hyde held the house in pawn from
17th September 1579 till 7th June 1589, during which time
Burbage remained legal and ostensible owner. At the
latter date it was restored, but to Cuthbert, not to James
Burbage. Against the dangers of debt and public interference
he still bravely fought, but even in “The Liberty
of Holywell” troubles assailed him. Mr. Cordy Jeaffreson,
in editing the Middlesex County Records for James I,
found among them a few entries of Elizabeth’s reign, and
among these is the record of the presentation at Clerkenwell
Sessions of John Braynes of Shoreditch yeoman, and
James Burbage of the same, yeoman, 21st February 22 Eliz.,<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
on the charge of</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“bringing together unlawful assemblies to hear and to see certain
colloquies or interludes called playes or interludes exercised and
practised by the same John Braynes and James Burbage, and
divers other persons unknown at a certain place called The
Theatre at Holywell in the county of Middlesex, by reason of
which great affrays, assaults, tumults and quasi-insurrections and
divers other misdeeds and enormities ... perpetrated to the
danger of the lives of divers good subjects ... against the form
of the Statute,” etc.</p>
</div>

<p>This shows that Braynes, though not mentioned in the
original patent, had become one of Burbage’s players. But
it hardly supports Mr. Jeaffreson’s contention that he must
have been the <i>chief</i> player and proprietor of The Theatre.
Braynes might very well have been placed first as being
the elder, and apparently the richer, of the two, and they
might have agreed to put Braynes forward as the chief, so
as to bear the brunt of the examination, while Burbage
was looking after his plays, his house, his rehearsals, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
his audience. Braynes was a business man, quite able to
face an attorney and a magistrate, but he was second fiddle
at The Theatre.</p>

<p>It is curious to remember that the great earthquake took
place about six weeks later, 6th April 1580. Enemies read
in it a token of God’s wrath against The Theatre. Ballads
were written to bid men haste away from the play because
of the earthquake.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> But we have no record of any damage
at The Theatre, or to Burbage’s house in Holywell Street,
though many chimneys fell in more respectable places.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>The Lord Mayor wrote to the Lords of the Council,<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
“Where it happened on Sunday last that some great disorder
was committed at the Theatre, I sent for the Undersherive
... and for the players to have appeared before me, the
rather because these playes doe make assemblies of citizens
and of their families of whom I have charge,” but hearing
the Council was considering the matter he “surceased to
proceed,” but thought it his duty to remind them “that the
players of playes which are used at the Theatre, and other
such places ... are a very superfluous sort of men, and of
suche facultie as the lawes have disalowed.” An order of
the Privy Council was issued to forbid all plays in and
about the City till Michaelmas next, 13th May 1580. Five
months’ forced “unemployment,” with his rent, his interest
running on, his creditors clamouring, his housekeeper asking
for food, and his company doubtless worrying him for
money. His was the fate of Tantalus, for the golden stream
was ever at his lips. The constant interference with the
players only increased the eagerness of the populace to see
them. Battles with courtiers, preachers, citizens, authors,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
raged round Burbage’s head. But he played at Court that
Christmas as usual. In 1583 the Queen, to keep up with
her nobles, resolved to patent a Royal Company of her
own, and exercising her prerogative of “taking up,” not
only singing boys, but any<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> “men” she needed for her
service, she took the pick of the players from all the companies,
among them Robert Wilson and Richard Tarleton.
This did not really hurt them much, as they remained on
friendly terms, and often played with their old companies.
The Queen’s players had their first performances at Court,
with but few others, during the Christmas of 1583-4.</p>

<p>In 1584 Fleetwood wrote to Lord Burleigh that the Lord
Mayor desired to suppress all playhouses, and had sent for
the players themselves to come to him, among them the
Queen’s players and Lord Arundel’s players. “They all
well nighe obeyed the Lordes letters: the chiefest of her
Higheness’s players advised me to send for the owner of
The Theatre, who was a stubborne fellow, and to bind him:
I did so. He sent me word that he was my Lord of
Hunsdon’s man, and that he would not comme at me, but
he would in the morning ride to his Lord. I sent the
Under-Sheriff for him but he would not be bound.”<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> This
has been supposed not to refer to Burbage, because he said
he was Lord Hunsdon’s man. But there was no one else
who could be called <i>owner</i> of The Theatre, no one so resourceful
and so daring. He was any Lord’s man, so that
it was not the Lord Mayor’s, and, seeing what the Earl of
Leicester was about, he was off to Court, to ask his Lord
what his Royal Patent meant when a mere Lord Mayor
could flout it so. After that his Company became Lord
Hunsdon’s (then the Lord Chamberlain) till the Queen’s
death. That danger passed.</p>

<p>Before April 1586 Burbage had the proposed new lease<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
of his property drawn up to add ten years after the expiration
of the first lease, but Giles Allen refused to sign it. He
denied that the £200, as agreed, had really been spent on
the repair of the old tenements; he said there were alterations
from the old lease, though Burbage explained that
the difference only lay in not including a clause and condition
for further extension of lease. Alleyn showed a
shifty desire to juggle with the 1576 agreement, and,
having an exaggerated idea of the net profits realized by
Burbage, he wanted to raise the rent from £14 to £24;
and while granting the ten years’ extra lease of the soil,
he wanted to restrict the further use of The Theatre as a
playing place to a term of <i>five</i> more years, after which it
might be used for <i>some other purpose</i> by Burbage. It was
clear that Burbage was not going to sign a lease at the
raised rent without having the use of his theatre during
the full term, so the two second leases lay in abeyance, and
landlord and tenant spent the remaining eleven years of the
first lease suspicious of each other, and watching every
turn of events.</p>

<p>In 1586 a new set of troubles arose through the death of
John Braynes, who, apparently by the influence of his wife
Margaret and the pressure of circumstances, had not remained
quite as brotherly as he had formerly been.
Through fear of being called on to pay theatre debts, he
had made a deed of gift of his goods and chattels to
Robert Myles, goldsmith, to one Tomson, and also to John
Gardiner. Margaret Braynes, widow, had herself a suit
against Robert Myles, and in Easter 1587,<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> “a week is
granted him to make answer, or an attachment will be
granted.” By this time John Gardiner had died, and his
administrator, Robert Gardiner, claimed to be executor of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
Braynes in his place. The widow, Myles, and Gardiner
united to worry Burbage. They refused to consider the
notion that Braynes meant his investment in building The
Theatre to come eventually to his nephews, or that through
his breach of agreement he had forfeited his bond, and
they made themselves very harassing.</p>

<p>Halliwell-Phillipps, and all the writers who follow him,
say the first action was taken in the Chancery suit of
Braynes <i>v.</i> Burbage, 1590. But it began long before that.
He had never seen the earlier suit of Burbage <i>v.</i> Braynes,<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
nor followed its various stages through Chancery. I am not
able to give the exact date of this first action, as the document
is very much injured, but I <i>believe</i> it is 1588. The plaintiffs
are James Burbage, Ellen his wife, and Cuthbert, Richard,
Alice, and Ellen their children <i>v.</i> Margaret Braynes. This
explains how James had taken the land from Giles Alleyn,
and how his brother-in-law had agreed to go shares with
him in The Theatre and the George Inn. There had been
an arbitration between them which had been in favour of
Burbage, on 12th July 1578, and Braynes had forfeited a
bond of £200 through not obeying the arbitration. Braynes
had conveyed his goods and chattels to Myles, to Tomson,
and to John Gardiner, and had ceased to pay his share of
expenses. But shortly before his death he confessed that
his moietie should all remain to Burbage’s children. The
defendants claimed the same, only under an old will made
before the conveyances and against the arbitration. Robert
Myles “enters The Theatre and troubles your orator, and
his tenants,” and Robert Gardiner, the administrator of John
Gardiner, who died in 1587, “goes about to sue James
Burbage in two several bonds,” and “by reason of the
multiplicity of their conveyances they joyn together to
imprison your said orator, to enforce him to yield to their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
request.” They will not pay the £200 bond forfeited by
Braynes; their action is costly, and leads to his impoverishment.
He prays relief, and a subpœna to the defendants
to appear personally and answer material facts, and he is
willing to submit to justice. Their answer is, of course, that
his is an untrue and insufficient bill. I suppose this is the
case referred to in the Decree<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> that the defendants have
put in an insufficient demurrer. It was referred to Mr.
Dr. Carew, and if he thought it insufficient, a subpœna to
be awarded against the defendants. Margaret Braynes,
Myles, and Gardiner had meanwhile brought a cross-suit
against the Burbages; and in that, on 21st May 1590,<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> the
court was informed that the defendants put in an insufficient
demurrer, and it also is referred to Mr. Dr. Carew
for the same purpose. This came up again in the Trinity
term,<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> and on 4th November Mrs. Braynes appeals again,
through Mr. Scott,<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> for the moietie of The Theatre and
other tenements; the defendants have put in an ill demurrer,
and take the whole gains and benefits of the premises, albeit
she and her husband had been at very great charges in the
building of The Theatre, to the sum of £500, and did for a
time enjoy the moietie. It is ordered that if the defendants
do not show good cause, sequestration of the moietie shall
be granted. On 13th November<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Mr. Serjeant Harrys, for
Burbage, prayed consideration of a former order made in
his behalf in the suit of Burbage <i>v.</i> Braynes. There had
been an arbitrament made on 12th July 1578, in favour of
Burbage, and neither of the parties showed why the arbitration
should not be performed. Sequestration was stayed.
This promised peace; but on 20th January 1590-1<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Robert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
Myles made oath that the Burbages had broken an order
made in court on 13th November; therefore an attachment
was awarded for contempt. On 30th January<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Cuthbert Burbage
made his personal appearance to save his bond to the
Sheriff of London, but nothing was done. On 23rd March<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
it was stated in court that the Burbages had been examined
upon interrogatories, and these committed to the consideration
of Mr. Dr. Cæsar. On 24th April 1591,<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Burbage continued
his case against Mrs. Braynes, she having put in an
insufficient demurrer; consideration was referred to Mr.
Dr. Carew. On 15th June,<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> as nothing material had been
advanced on her side, Burbage asked for a subpœna
against her and Myles. On 20th July<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Margaret Braynes
appeared in her own case against Cuthbert and James
Burbage; they also appeared, but the Master in Charge
could not attend. On 12th October 1591<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> it was decided
that no advantage should be given until it was found whether
Burbage had committed contempt of court; and on 13th
November<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> it was heard again. It had been referred to Mr.
Dr. Stanhop and Mr. Dr. Legg, who had heard counsel on
both sides, but they could not well proceed to examine the
parties before they examined John Hyde of London, grocer,
Ralph Myles of London, “sopemaker,” Nicholas Bushop
and John Allen upon the contempt pretended. The need
of considering these witnesses arose in this way. Burbage,
at some date, following his brother-in-law’s lead, had transferred
all his property to his sons. Hyde, holding The
Theatre for ten years, had released it to Cuthbert. To
Robert Myles had been let the George Inn, part of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
Holywell property; Myles had let the stables to his son,
Ralph Myles, and Nicholas Bushop<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> for a soap manufactory.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>One is interested to know the inns at which Shakespeare
might have “taken his ease.” Here is one, on the very
Theatre ground. Was it in his thought when he wrote, in
“King John,”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">St. George, who swinged the Dragon, and ere since</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sits on his horseback at mine hostess’ door.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>For by this time Burbage had got firm hold of Shakespeare.
He was learning all round, <i>even law</i> through the troubles
of Burbage, helping all round, becoming a “Johannes
Factotum ... a Shakescene able to bumbast out a blank
verse as well as the best of you!” Was there a little bit of
lively badinage of James Burbage when, in the play suggesting
the Earl of Leicester and his Kenilworth festivities,
“Midsummer Night’s Dream,” he cast, in the artisan’s play
“Snug the <i>Joiner</i>,” for the Lion’s part?</p>

<p>The plague caused a lull in the Chancery proceedings, but
they started again. Latterly Margaret Braynes died, but
Robert Myles continued <i>versus</i> Burbage and Burbage <i>versus</i>
Myles. The next best thing for him to a speedy settlement in
his favour was delay. Time told for him. On 4th February
1595-6 James Burbage, “gent.,” purchased from Sir William
More for £600 some rooms in the dissolved Monastery of
Blackfriars,<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> also out of the jurisdiction of the City authorities.
Throughout that year he urged on the alterations of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
rooms into a winter theatre, that his brilliant son Richard
might not be hindered in his performances by further
troubles at The Theatre. By 16th November the inhabitants
of the Blackfriars had sent up a petition against the starting
of a playhouse there; a copy, undated, is preserved
among the State papers.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> But the date can be found in a
later petition and order at the Guildhall, which implies that
the first had been successful, at least for a time.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> James
Burbage, therefore, though the inventor and designer of
the modern theatre in stone and brick as well as in wood,
in the famous theatre afterwards called the private stage of
Blackfriars, did not see his son Richard triumph there.
Baffled in that, he “laboured with Giles Alleyn to sign the
extended lease of Holywell drawn up in 1586, and got his
friends also to move him.” Probably among these were
the Earls of Southampton and Rutland, whose property
bordered his ground.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Giles Alleyn was, however, unresponsive.
Amid the anxious discussions with his sons concerning
their critical future, I feel sure that James planned
the manœuvre, which afterwards proved really successful.
He thought that if he could but carry that out as he wished,
he would be able to fight all his enemies at once, and give his
beloved Theatre a new lease of life. But he was not so
young as he had been, the strain of his strenuous work had
told upon him, and sorrow for losses by death. Just a year
after he had bought his Blackfriars property and just before
the lease of his Theatre had run, the lease of his life ended;
he died suddenly, and was buried in St. Leonard’s, Shoreditch,
2nd February, 1596-7.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XVIII">XVIII<br><span class="small">THE TRANSPORTATION OF BURBAGE’S
“THEATRE”</span></h2></div>


<p>The story of the dramatic transportation of “The
Theatre” from the north to the south bank of the
Thames is well known to every student of Shakespeare’s
life. But Halliwell-Phillipps, who did so much to bring forward
new facts concerning it, rarely gives his references,
and, among the mass of material which must have passed
through his hands, he neglected sufficiently to compare
and collate different papers. Hence he did not complete
the story of “The Theatre.”</p>

<p>James Burbage had died in February 1597, just before
the conclusion of the twenty-one years’ lease granted by
Giles Alleyn, who had been juggling with his promise to
lengthen it by ten years, on the plea that the conditions
had not been fulfilled. Burbage’s sons were already in possession
(see my paper “Burbage’s Theatre,” “Fortnightly
Review,” July 1909). Richard Burbage entered into negotiations
with Henry Evans about a lease of the newly altered
theatre at Blackfriars. The Privy Council, on 28th July
1597, had issued an order that the Theatre and the Curtain
should be pulled down, or at least dismantled, so as to
make them unfit for stage-playing. It was a hard saying,
for it meant that all the money, energy, and ingenuity
which had been put into the realization of Burbage’s great
idea would be dissipated <i>without any compensation</i>, while
imitations survived. Cuthbert Burbage, evidently hoping
that he would find friends at Court to help him to weather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
the storm, as he had done before, renewed his entreaties to
Alleyn to extend the lease. Alleyn temporized, but allowed
him to continue on the old terms for the time. Probably
he had no better offer on hand. The Lord Chamberlain’s
company went on tour in the summer, when all companies
were forbidden to act in the City until Allhallows-tide;
but they were engaged to play at Court at Christmas as
usual. The year 1598 was critical for them; it is uncertain
whether they played at their own “Theatre” or not.
Guilpin’s “Skialethia,” published that year, says:</p>

<p>Shakespeare’s friend, the Earl of Southampton, had lost
favour with the Queen through his marriage with Elizabeth
Vernon. On the other hand, Shakespeare himself had been
glorified by Francis Meres, Professor of Rhetoric in Oxford;
and Richard Burbage had been generally recognized as the
greatest genius on the stage. Hesitation ended when
Cuthbert Burbage heard privately that his ground landlord
meant to pull down his “Theatre,” ostensibly in obedience
to the order of the Privy Council, but really that he might
confiscate its materials to repay himself for the mortifications
and losses that he fancied he had unjustly endured.
Cuthbert looked at Southwark <i>over ye sea</i>, where already
Henslowe had prospered in the Rose, and Langley in the
Swan, and, secretly finding a site to the east of these,
removed.</p>

<p>We are accustomed to think of the building as the permanent
and fixed item and the players as the transitory
and passing element in a whole theatre. But on this occasion
the company, like the snail, in its exodus from Middlesex,
carried its house on its back. Two contemporary
descriptions of the event give different dates. The Star<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
Chamber proceedings, 44 Eliz., A. xii, 35, state that it was
on 28th December 1598; the Coram Rege Roll, Trinity
Term 42 Eliz., 587, says it was on the 20th of January
following. Possibly the wardrobe and the stuff, the portable
properties, and the play-books went on the first date to
safe storage; and the solid framework on the later date.
But I think authority is all in favour of the earlier date. It
was a stiff piece of work to take down and carry away
the materials in a short time; it would necessitate a little
army of housebreakers and transplanters, probably aided
by the players themselves. They had more work to do
than they bargained for, as they met sturdy opposition
from Giles Alleyn’s men, who saw their expected job and
pickings thus torn away from them. It is likely that the
night would be selected by the phase of the moon and the
time of the tide, for it cannot be supposed that Cuthbert
would be rash enough to carry his materials in a train of
lumbering wagons across London Bridge, paying wheelage
and passage dues, under the danger of being stopped to
explain at any point. He would be certain to ship them
over the water. He was fortunate in the man he employed,
Peter Street, an “ordinary servant of the Queen’s Household.”
I find, from an earlier lawsuit (Court of Requests,
91/57, January 1597), that Peter Street had a wharf of his
own handy near Bridewell Stairs, whence he probably
wafted the lot in a little flotilla of boats and barges, at high
tide, to the wharf on Bankside, nearest his new site. The
night of 28th December 1598, or rather the following dawn,
saw a pile of unsightly wreckage lying on the southern
bank of the Thames, beyond Giles Alleyn’s control or the
Lord Mayor’s jurisdiction. Peter Street did his best;
Burbage did his best; the shareholders were eager, and
moneylenders ready; and in a very short time a new
“Theatre” rose, like the phœnix, from the ashes of the
old. Shakespeare by that time knew what was in a name,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
and as the decree had gone out against “The Theatre,” they
changed its name. Was it because they knew “all the
world’s a stage” that they called it then “the Globe”?
There Shakespeare was free to create, and Burbage to interpret
his creations. Londoners on the other side had
known of its exodus, and had watched its rising, and again
it was its own advertisement. The hopes of the Thames
watermen were radiant as it grew.</p>

<p>The litigation which had handicapped the Burbages had
ceased with the death of the two principals, Margaret
Braynes and James Burbage. But Cuthbert, even before
he left Holywell, had been sucked again into the vortex of
the law. In Trinity Term 38 Eliz., 1596, while his father
was yet alive, Cuthbert had sued in the King’s Bench,
Roger Ames, John Powell, and Richard Robinson, because
they had on 1st May 1596 trespassed <i>vi et armis</i> on the
inner close of Cuthbert Burbage at Holywell, had destroyed
grass to the value of 40<i>s.</i>, and had kept the close from the
1st of May till the 27th of June in their own custody, the
damage in all amounting to £20. One can read between
the lines that in May 1596 James Burbage would be away
superintending hurried building alterations in his newly
purchased property at Blackfriars, and the company would
be on tour to earn their livelihood. The case did not come
on for hearing until Tuesday in the Octaves of Hilary,
which fell on or about this very removal day, 20th January
1598-9 (Coram Rege Rolls, Hilary 41 Eliz., r. 320). No
one has hitherto understood the full bearing of this case,
through lack of the light shed on it by a later case (Exchequer
Bills and Answers, No. 369, and Exchequer
Depositions, 44-45 Eliz., No. 18). Thence we find that
Cuthbert Burbage was really in this case acting on behalf
of Giles Alleyn, and in co-operation with him, against the
three defendants. These, Giles Alleyn said, had been put
forward by the Earl of Rutland, the neighbouring land-owner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
or rather by command of his steward, Thomas
Scriven. They had ejected Cuthbert from the inner court,
and inclosed it with a mud wall. Cuthbert had brought
an action against Ames and the others for loss of profits;
Thomas Scriven, without the knowledge of the Earl, who
was a minor and a royal ward, and “was beyond the seas,”
caused information to be sent to “the Court of Wards and
Liveries”<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> against Cuthbert Burbage and <i>Richard</i> Allen,
“misnaming him of purpose that he might not answer.”
There had been an injunction issued to stay Burbage’s
suit against Ames till the facts should be considered in the
Court of Wards. This continued for two years, when, the
Earl having come of age and sued his livery, the power of
that court ceased, Burbage went on with his suit, and
Ames, Powell, and Robinson were forced to plead. They
denied force and injury, and demanded to be tried by a
jury. The real cause at issue was as to the ownership of
“the Capital Mansion House of the late dissolved Priory
of St. John Baptist in Holywell.” The Earl of Rutland
claimed that his father had had a lease of it from the
Queen, with many years yet to run, and that “the
void ground” was part of the estate. Cuthbert Burbage
had wrongfully entered it, and the Earl’s undertenants had
justly withstood him. Giles Alleyn answered that it was
true “the void ground” did belong to the capital mansion
house, but the capital mansion house did not belong to the
Earl. His was only a secondary house, which the Earl’s
father had enlarged. The real Capital Mansion House had
been granted by Henry VIII to Henry Webbe for £136.
He settled it on his daughter Susan when she married Sir
George Peckham. They sold it to Christopher Bumpstead,
mercer, for £533 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> in 1556, and in that same year he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
sold it to Christopher and Giles Alleyn for £600. Giles
held it as the survivor, and drew his rents peaceably till
1st May 1596, when Thomas Scriven commanded Ames
to enter, and Cuthbert Burbage sued them under Giles
Alleyn’s title. Thomas Scriven had had the case repeatedly
postponed, to the great trouble and cost to
Alleyn.</p>

<p>Cuthbert Burbage had therefore, during this critical time,
shared with his landlord the trouble and worry of this suit
against “the trespassers,” though apparently Giles Alleyn
was responsible for the costs.</p>

<p>In this very Hilary Term, January 1598-9, Cuthbert’s
infuriated and unexpectedly-outwitted landlord took the
preliminary steps for bringing a suit against him, or rather
against his agent, Peter Street, in the Court of the King’s
Bench, also for trespass on the same ground! A strange
cross-suit indeed! He made his complaint in Easter Term,
41 Eliz. (see Coram Rege Roll, Trinity Term 42 Eliz.,
No. 587). This is one of four suits, of which Halliwell-Phillips
speaks, and quotes largely from three. But as he
did not study their relative dates, and the bearing of the
one upon the other, and as he had not <i>read</i> the fourth, the
later Star Chamber case, he has missed the legal bearing
of them all, and is ignorant of the decisions in any of them.
It is very easy, and it becomes very interesting to collate
them. In the 1602 Star Chamber case Alleyn says he
began his suit against Burbage in the Hilary Term following
28th December 1598; but that would be about 20th
January 1598-9, the second date given for the transportation
of “The Theatre,” and the time of the hearing of the case
brought by Burbage <i>and</i> Alleyn versus Ames and others.
I think he was in error, because it is stated in Coram Rege
Roll, 42 Eliz., 587, that Giles Alleyn had commenced his
suit against Peter Street in Easter Term, 1599, but it had
been postponed. This was because Cuthbert Burbage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
appealed to the Court of Requests, 42 Eliz., 87/74 to stay
this suit. Burbage in his complaint, dated 26th January
1599-1600, states simply that Giles Alleyn and his wife,
Sara, owners of certain garden grounds and tenements near
Holywell, in the parish of St. Leonard’s, Shoreditch, on
13th April 1576, granted them to his father James for
good consideration, for a term of twenty-one years at £14
a year. The condition was that if he had spent £200 on
the repair of the tenements (not the theatre) before the end
of the first ten years, he could then sue for a new lease at
the same rent for a new term of twenty-one years, making
thirty-one years in all. He could, at the end of either
term, carry away any building he had put up for himself.
James Burbage was to pay the expenses of drawing up
the second lease. All these conditions James Burbage had
faithfully performed. But Giles Alleyn would not sign that
lease when drawn up, substituting another, in which the
Burbages were to pay £10 more annual rent, and not use
“The Theatre,” <i>as a theatre</i>, for more than five years of
the second term. James Burbage would not sign such a
lease, nor would Cuthbert; but the latter had stayed on at
the old rent, buoyed up by the hopes of having <i>his</i> new
lease signed. It was only when he heard that Alleyn was
about to take away the Theatre that he did so himself,
which he had a perfect right to do. Alleyn was prosecuting
his suit against Peter Street with “rigour and extremity”;
the heavy damages he claimed would injure him much.
Cuthbert prayed, therefore, that the suit in the King’s
Bench might be stayed, and Alleyn summoned to answer
personally in this Court.</p>

<p>Giles Alleyn presented his voluminous “answer” on
6th February 1599-1600. He said, of course, that the
complaint was untrue, and “exhibited of malice.” He
went through the original lease, with a few glosses. He
refused to sign the new lease because it was different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
from the original one; also because James Burbage had
not spent the £200 in repairs, and there were arrears of
rent. “He was a troublesome tenant. When he had tried
to distrain for rent, either the doors and gates were kept
shut, or there was nothing left to distraine.” He had
offered to give Cuthbert a new lease, with good security
and increased rent. He could well afford it, seeing he had
made at least £2,000 by the Theatre. He had heard
it had been built at the charges of John Braynes, whom
James Burbage defrauded,<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> as Cuthbert now defrauded
Robert Myles, his executor. It was manifestly illegal for
Burbage to remove the Theatre.</p>

<p>Cuthbert’s “replication” is dated 27th April 1600. He
said he could prove everything in his complaint, and denied
all Alleyn’s charges. If his father delayed paying the rent,
it was owing to the trouble and expense he had had in
keeping the property against Edward Peckham, who disputed
Alleyn’s right to it. He could bring the workmen’s
bills to show that his father had spent the £200 in repairs.
He himself had disbursed a large sum since. He had been
quite willing to sign a fair lease such as his father drew up.
The sole difference from the first lay in its containing no
clause for the further extension of the lease. A Royal
Commission was issued on 5th June to examine witnesses
on interrogatories, the depositions to be returned by
Michaelmas 1600. The depositions on behalf of Giles
Alleyn were taken at Kelvedon, Essex, on 14th August.
They were not very convincing. The depositions on behalf
of Street and Burbage are not among the Calendared
Proceedings of the Court of Requests, or we might have
had some interesting names as well as facts. But they
appear to have prevailed. No one seems to have found
the decisions in any of the cases. But I have found from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
the Star Chamber case Alleyn’s statement, “<i>Thereby I
lost my suit</i>.” This case, therefore, is the only one of the
four which came to a conclusion. The 5th of June 1600,
on which Alleyn’s witnesses were being examined, is in
Trinity Term, and it was in this Trinity Term that Giles
Alleyn sued Peter Street in the postponed action in the
King’s Bench, regardless of the injunction from the Court
of Requests, or the order that the answers were to be
returned at Michaelmas, It is from this King’s Bench case
(Coram Rege Roll, Trin. 42 Eliz. 587) that Halliwell-Phillipps
selected his lengthy extracts. But the vital points
are missed. The Court, “not being sufficiently informed
of particulars,” postponed the hearing till Michaelmas, and
it was never heard. Why? Because on 18th October
42 Eliz., the Privy Council decreed, through the Court of
Requests, that Giles Alleyn and his attorneys should from
thence surcease, and no further prosecute the action at
common law for trespass, and should never commence any
suit for the <i>pulling down of the Theatre</i>, and that Cuthbert
Burbage should be at liberty to take his remedy at Common
Law against Alleyn for not agreeing to seal the second
lease. (See “The demurrer of Cuthbert Burbage, Richard
Burbage, Peter Street, and William Smith to Giles Alleyn’s
complaint” in the Star Chamber case, 23rd November,
44 Eliz., 1601, A. xii/35.)</p>

<p>In Hilary Term 43 Eliz., 1601, postponed till Easter,
44 Eliz., Alleyn sued a plea of broken agreement against
Cuthbert Burbage in his own name (Coram Rege Roll,
1373, r. 255, Easter 44 Eliz.).</p>

<p>Then Giles Alleyn, still at white heat, brought the noteworthy,
though hitherto unnoted, complaint in the Star
Chamber, again defying legal etiquette and legal decision,
23rd November 44 Eliz., 1601. He recited the well-known
indenture and conditions, and further blackened the character
of the Burbages by saying that Braynes, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
Burbage, had built the Theatre at the cost of 1,000 marks.
(Mrs. Braynes herself only claimed to have contributed
£500 for their moiety; see D. and O. Books, Chancery A.,
1590, p. 109.) “Cuthbert, desiring to make gain, allowed
the theatre to remain after the expiry of the lease, when it
became clearly vested in the Landlord,” who, “seeing the
grievous abuses that came by the said Theatre, resolved to
pull it downe”; but Cuthbert carried it away “in and
about 28th December, 1598.” Alleyn claimed to have
commenced an action in Hilary Term following (<i>i.e.</i> January
1599); but Cuthbert exhibited a bill to stay him in Easter.
We have proved both of his dates incorrect. Alleyn goes
on to make an extraordinary charge—that Burbage had
combined with John Maddox, his attorney, and Richard
Lane, the Register of the Court of Requests, to draw up a
forged order that he should not make any demurrer.
Being ignorant of this, he drew up a demurrer and went
home to Haseley, thinking everything settled till the case
should be heard. But Burbage gave information that he
had “broken order,” and he was, for supposed contempt,
in the vacation time following, fetched up to London by
a pursuivant, “to his great vexation and annoyance, a man
very aged and unfitt to travell, to his excessive charges in
journey, and likewise to his great discredit and disgrace
among his neighbours in the country.” The pursuivant
brought him to a Master of the Court of Requests, and
bound him in a bond of £200 to Cuthbert to appear at
Michaelmas, when he was purged of contempt. Alleyn
further said he had witnesses to bring up, but Cuthbert
and Richard Burbage, reviling them because they had
formerly testified untruths, threatened to stab them if they
did it again, so that the witnesses were terrified and could
not testify on his behalf. Meanwhile Burbage suborned
his witnesses “to commit grievous perjury” concerning the
costs of James Burbage, “by which unlawful practises your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
said subject <i>did then lose his case</i>.” Further, in the suit
between him and Peter Street, and between him and
Cuthbert Burbage, one William Smith laid out “divers
sums of money on their behalf, whereby arose forcible
entries, abuse of justice, law, and order, and examples of
misdemeanour worthy of punishment.” Cuthbert and
Richard Burbage and the others denied all his charges,
and denied “the riott in pulling down the said playhouse
called the Theatre.” Cuthbert “in conscience, being the
assignee, could justify it, although not in strictness of
common law, by Alleyn’s breach of covenant.” Therefore
he had sought relief in the Court of Requests, which on
18th October 1600, non-suited Alleyn, and forbade him
ever again from bringing another “action for pulling down
<i>of The Theatre</i>.” Cuthbert added that Alleyn “offers great
scandal and abuse to your Majesty’s Council by calling the
same matter again in question, after such judiciall sentence
and decree passed against him.” On 12th June 1602,
Richard Lane, “who was then and is still acting as deputy
Register in the Court of Requests,” denied Alleyn’s charge
against himself. His whole procedure had been what he
was accustomed to for the past thirty years; he therefore
denied the charge of forgery. On 17th June Richard
Hudson and Thomas Osborne denied the charge of perjury
brought by Alleyn against them. After these wholesale
denials Giles Alleyn’s bill of complaint and the demurrers
were referred to the consideration of “the right worshipful
Mr. Francis Bacon, Esq.”; and he decided that Giles
Alleyn’s bill of complaint was very uncertain and insufficient
in law, and <i>no further answer need be made to it</i>.
This means that it was dismissed. This is my first discovery
of any association between Francis Bacon and the
theatre, and even the Baconians must allow it was a purely
legal one, and not literary.</p>

<p>Alleyn defied legal etiquette and legal decision by continuing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
the postponed suit against the same man in another
court. This is the case in the Queen’s Bench (Coram Rege
Roll, Easter 44 Eliz. R. 257), which is varied from the
former one in that court by being brought directly against
Burbage, instead of his servant Peter Street. The case
gives the former recitals quoted by Halliwell-Phillipps,
who apparently did not understand that Burbage argued
this time that Alleyn was incompetent to bring the action.
Giles Alleyn and Sara his wife appealed to the country
for a jury. This was never summoned, because, Alleyn’s
case being dismissed from the Star Chamber in Trinity,
44 Eliz., he was left by the previous decision of the
Court of Requests incompetent at law to bring the case
at all.</p>

<p>I can only account for Giles Alleyn’s audacity in bringing
such a case again by the fact that since the Privy
Council’s decision had occurred, the Essex conspiracy,
executions, imprisonments, and fines had occupied the
attention of the Privy Council, and weakened the strength
of the players’ friends at Court. Burbage’s company themselves
had not escaped without suspicion: Augustine
Phillips had been summoned, though he had proved his
innocence, and the company performed at Court till the
eve of the executions.</p>

<p>Giles Alleyn was a stubborn and testy man, and very
likely would have revived the case the following year in the
new reign. But, unfortunately for him, the new sovereign
from the first showed decided favour to these special
players, and, among the first acts he performed in his reign,
patented them to be his own Royal Servants and Grooms
of the Chamber. Exit “Giles Alleyn, Armiger.” After that,
the troubles were ended concerning the transportation of
the Theatre over the water to Southwark and its transformation
into the Globe, though the losses crippled the
company for long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>This paper acts as the second part of my answer to the
Baconian query, “Where did Shakespeare learn his law?”</p>

<p class="right">
<i>“Athenæum,” Oct. 16, 1909.</i><br>
</p>

<p>PS.—These latter two articles and several lectures on
the same subject were expanded into a volume called
“Burbage and Shakespeare’s Stage,” delayed by my printers
until July 1913, and then delayed by my wish in publication
till 8th September 1913. Later in the same year
came out Dr. Wallace’s “Nebraska University Studies,”
where he gives many of the documents <i>in extenso</i>, along
with some interesting depositions from the Uncalendared
Court of Requests which he was permitted to see in
advance of others. He has chosen to add a note that “<i>he
told me</i>,” in 1908, of all these papers above-mentioned.
He is mistaken. If he ever told anybody it must have
been somebody else. Neither then, nor at any time, did
he ever tell me anything that I wished to know. I had
all my papers before he began his work, which I can prove.</p>

<p>The exact locality of early Piccadilly, the date of the
first appearance of the name, and its derivation from
a “collar,” a “gaming-house,” or a “hill-peak,” have been
frequently discussed by London topographers and by
writers in “Notes and Queries.”<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> I do not pretend to be
able to decide the third question, but I have collected some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
definite facts concerning the first and second which are
worth preserving, as they may prevent futile discussions
and may hereafter help to the elucidation of the derivation.</p>

<p>Many writers, stating that the name was first used by
Gerard in his “Herbal,” assume that he did so in his first
edition of 1597. This is an error. It first appears in the
edition of 1633. I have, however, found the word used at
least ten years earlier than that, not in connection with
“Higgins the draper,” as Walford suggests (who really
lived at “the Mearemaide”), but in connection with
“Robert Baker, Gent., of Piccadilly Hall, St. Martin-in-the-Fields.”
“Piccadilly,” like many other names and things,
has travelled considerably westward in its day. There is
no mention of the name in any book, nor, so far as has yet
been discovered, in any manuscript, of Elizabeth’s reign.
Having found Mr. Baker first associated with it, I worked
back on his traces.</p>

<p>In Aggas’s map, which shows the appearance of the
neighbourhood at the beginning of the reign of Elizabeth,
there is a mass of building about the royal mews, facing
St. Martin’s Church (on the present site of the National Gallery), and open fields stretching beyond to the
country. The wall of Convent Garden formed the eastern
boundary of St. Martin’s Lane, or, as it was then called,
Church Lane. There were a few buildings about St. Giles’s,
and <i>one</i> at the end of St. Martin’s Lane, commonly described
as “<i>over</i> the Church Lane.” The district does not seem to
have changed much in the early years of James’s reign.
The churchwardens of St. Martin-in-the-Fields regularly
entered receipts for the rent of “the house <i>over</i> Church
Lane,” but the first sign of an enclosure of the Fields
appears in the books of 1612, when they stated they had
“received from Roger Haighton, steward of the Right Hon.
Earl of Salisbury, Lord High Treasurer of England, on
February 17th, 1611, 50s, for a yeares rent of five acres of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
ground in the Lammas Common, heretofore called Swanne
Close, whereuppon the new buildings are erected to the
west of St. Martin’s Lane.” In the following year, 1612-3,
there is a similar entry and the record of a new tenant:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Item, receved of Robert Baker Tayler, for the Lammas ground
which he built uppon neare the Windmill, for one year ended
Lammas Day, 1612, 30<i>s.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The next year similar rents are recorded, and a topographical
entry:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Received of Francis Gilford, Inholder, towards the charges of
throwing up the ditch, and amending the highway of the upper
corner of St. James’s Fields, near the Windmill, 16<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>
</div>

<p>In 1614-5 the churchwardens admit a third encloser:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Received of Jeffrey Culsheth, gent., for one yeares rent of the
Lammas ground, which he enclosed with a brick wall for a
bowling alley, 10<i>s.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Ten shillings appears to be the ground rent of an acre of
ground in that neighbourhood then! The three rents reappear
in the following account, with the exception that
“for a bowling alley” is scratched out and is not repeated.
Other temporary enclosures near the almshouses in 1616
seem to have been recalled later. In 1619 the Earl of
Salisbury, Jeffrey Culsheth, and Robert Baker are still
tenants, and the last is described as “gent.” In 1621 the
name of Jeffrey Culsheth is omitted. In 1622-3 William
Warden is allowed “the gravel pitts hitherto demised to
Thomas Warden, 10<i>l.</i>” The Earl of Salisbury is still in
possession, but</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Receyved of the Executors of Robert Baker, gent., for the
Lammas Common of certain grounds lyeing at the Causeway-head,
near the Windmill, builded uppon by him, 30<i>s.</i>, in lieu of the said
Lammas Common, &amp;c., 30<i>s.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p>Here we may turn to another authority. The Overseers
of the Poor of St. Martin’s acknowledge in the record
of the same year 1622-3, “Landside ... Of Robert
Baker, <i>of Pickadilly Hall</i>, given by him by will, 3<i>l.</i>” This
then, is the first entry of the name that has yet been found,
and it is important to note that the term “Hall” is used.
This “Robert Baker, gent.,” made his will on 14 April
1623, and it was proved on 8 May of the same year.
He left Samuel Baker sole executor, to sell all leases,
pay all debts, and provide for the liberal education and
endowment of his children and his wife. His daughters
Judith and Mary were to have £600 each. His wife Mary
to have the house where he then dwelt, with the garden
and the cowhouse in St. Martin’s, and “2 houses in the
High Street neere against Brittaine’s Burse.” To his son
Samuel he left</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>a peece of ground divided into several parcels, and in part built
upon, containing about 2 acres, situated behind the muse of
St. Martin’s, which I lately enclosed with a brick wall, together
with all walls, stables, howses and edifices thereupon.</p>
</div>

<p>He also provided for his son Robert, and an unborn child,
who was to have “a close called Conduit Close” and the
reversion of the mother’s houses. The name Piccadilly nowhere
appears in the will, so it would seem not to have
been a name selected by himself. As Samuel was to have
two acres, doubtless the house and garden of Mr. Baker
occupied the other acre, thirty shillings being regularly paid
for the whole. With this will in memory, we may go back
to the churchwardens’ accounts, and find in the following
year, 1623-4:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Item, received of the executors of Samuel Baker, gent., deceased,
who was executor of Robert Baker, deceased, the some of
thirty shillings in lieu of the Lammas Common neare the Windmill,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
builded upon by him in his lifetime, and <i>lately called Pick a
dilly</i>, 30<i>s.</i></p>
</div>

<p>In 1624-5 the same entries continue, with only slight
variations. The Earl of Salisbury,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>for the <i>Swanne Close</i> upon which many faire dwelling houses have
been erected, and gardens belonging to them taken out of
it, 50<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Of the heirs or executors of Robert Baker ... for certain
ground near the Windmill at Causeway-head, and <i>usually</i> called
Pick a dilly, 30<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Item, received of John Johnson for a piece of ground heretofore
enclosed by Jeffrey Kelsey and used for a Bowling Alley, 10<i>s.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The entries of 1625-6 remain the same, but in 1626-7
“Mrs. Marie Baker, Widdowe,” pays for the ground</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>neare the Windmylne at the Causewayhead builded uppon in the
lyfetime of Robert Baker, her late husband, deceased, and <i>usually
now</i> called Pick a dillie, 30<i>s.</i></p>
</div>
<p>No Johnson or representative was charged for the bowling
alley. In 1628-9, other entries remaining the same, a new
tenant was admitted:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Hon. Sir William Howard, Knight, in lieu of the Lammas
Common of a certayne piece of ground called <i>the Swanne Close</i>,
whereuppon the same Sir William hath lately erected a faire
dwelling house, with a garden thereunto adjoyning taken out of
the same Close, and is the first yeares rent for the same, 10<i>s.</i></p>
</div>

<p>In 1631-2 to this small list is added another encloser:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Right Honble, the Earl of Leicester, for the Lammas
Common of a piece of ground adjoyning to the military garden,
newely enclosed with a brick wall, 30<i>s.</i></p>
</div>

<p>In 1632-3 the entries remain the same, Mrs. Marie Baker’s
lot being described as “usually nowe called Pickadilly.”
To the Earl of Leicester’s entry is added “and faire buildings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
thereuppon erected,” and his rent raised to £3. In
1634-5 the Earl of Newport held the land built on by Sir
William Howard, and an adjoining close. This small list
of enclosers remains the same. In 1638 the churchwardens’
books cease to record the rents, a special book after that
date being used for the Lammas lands.</p>

<p>Returning to the overseers’ books, we find Mrs. Mary
Baker assessed 16<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> in 1623-4, and 17<i>s.</i> in 1625-6. The
following year the residents are classified by their addresses,
and for the first time is mentioned “Pecadilly, Mrs. Mary
Baker, widow, 11<i>s.</i>, John Woode, 2<i>s.</i>, Isabell Ridley, 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>,”
which entries imply subletting. In 1634-5 she was only
charged 6<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, but no streets were named. In 1636,
under the wider address of “Brick hill, near Soho,” we find
“Mrs. Mary Baker, 18<i>s.</i>,” and “Symon Osbalston, Esq., 4<i>s.</i>”
which assessments in the following year are raised to 26<i>s.</i>
and 34<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> In 1637, under the heading “Brick Hill, near
Soho,” is specified “Pickadilly,” which now contains nine
names:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Widow Camell, 2<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>, William Vaugh, 2<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>, Thomas
Heylock, 2<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>, Mrs. Mary Baker, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, Sir Richard Grymes,
Knight, 9<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, William Larke, 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, Widow Bedwell, 2<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>,
Symme Osbaldston, 8<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, Anthony Walter, 6<i>d.</i></p>
</div>

<p>This certainly implies lodgers or subletting of houses on
her own or her son’s property, as the ground rent is still
paid in Mrs. Baker’s name. It is an important list, for it
shows that “the gaming-house” must have been very near,
or part and parcel of the Bakers’ lands.</p>

<p>In another book, entitled “An Abstract of Rents in St.
Martin’s-in-the-Fields,” there are entries concerning the
Earl of Salisbury and others which show that, though undated,
it commences about 1633. Mrs. Mary Baker has to
pay for “the Lammas common of the <i>land neere Pick a dillie</i>
where his buildings are erected, 30<i>s.</i>” The next folio is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
dated 1635, where her ground is “<i>usually now</i> called Pick
a dilly.” In that list appears “Of Symon Osbalston, Esq.,
for ground built upon sence, neere Pick a dilly, the some
of 4<i>l.</i>” There is some reverse writing on p. 1 of this volume,
which reads:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Item of Mr. Fox for the Bowling Greene and Bear <i>in Swanne
Close</i> yearely 10<i>l.</i></p>

<p>Rents due yearely from these undernamed for the ground rent
of the ground added to the ends of their gardens out of <i>Swanne
Close</i>, Mr. Dobbins, 1<i>l.</i>, Mr. Boulton, 12<i>s.</i>, Mr. Cooke, 4<i>s.</i>,
Mr. Temple, 1<i>l.</i>, Mr. Plunkett, 15<i>s.</i>, the Lady Vane, 1<i>l.</i>, the
Lady Armin, 2<i>l.</i>, Mr. Bull, 6<i>s.</i></p>
</div>

<p>A marginal reference adds, “The Earl of Leicester hath
these now.”</p>

<p>On p. 4, also reversed and without date:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Of the owners of Pickadilly House and Bowling Greens, 4<i>l.</i>
Of Mrs. Mary Baker, for the Lammas Common of grounds
whereon she hath houses at Pickadilly, 1<i>l.</i></p>
</div>

<p>These notices clearly show that the name was first applied
to the Bakers’ property, and the title of “Pickadilly
Hall” only applied to their house; that the neighbouring
building of Simon Osbaldistone’s, which became the
“gaming-house,” was built either partly on their ground or
in close proximity to it (probably including the old bowling
alley of Culsheth or Kelsey), and that it was therefore
called “Pickadilly House.”</p>

<p>The earliest notice of the name in the State Papers
occurs in “Dom. Ser. St. Pap. Car. I, 178 (43), 1630 (?),<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
note of priests and Jesuits now in England: ‘John Blundeston,
a priest, son to Blundeston in Fetter Lane, is now
much at Pecadily Hall at the Countess of Shrewsbury’s’”;
and in the same series, S. P. D. C. Car. I, 195 (3), on 24<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
June 1634, Rich. Wainwright and others, writing to Secretary
Dorchester, say:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This day at Lady Shrewsbury’s house at Piccadilly Hall, Parish
of St. Martin’s, Mass was said by Captain George Popham, Priest.
Richard Wainwright apprehended him, by the aid of Edward
Corbett the Constable, and took him to Somerset House, whence
he escaped, and was received by the Friars.</p>
</div>

<p>Evidently the countess at the time must have been renting
Mrs. Baker’s “Hall.”</p>

<p>An important description is preserved in a letter written
by the Rev. George Garrard, Master of the Charterhouse,
to the Earl of Strafford:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Since the spring garden was put down (1634), we have, by a
servant of the Lord Chamberlain’s, a new spring garden erected
in the fields beyond the Mews, where is built a fair house and
two bowling greens made to entertain gamesters and bowlers at an
excessive rate, for I believe it hath cost him above 4,000<i>l.</i>, a dear
undertaking for a gentleman barber. My Lord Chamberlain much
frequents that place, where they bowl great matches. June 24,
1635.</p>
</div>

<p>Garrard, writing to Edward, Viscount Conway, 30 May
1636, adds:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Simme Austbiston’s house is newly christened. It is called
Shaver’s Hall, as other neighbouring places are named Tart Hall,
Pickadell Hall. At first, no conceit there was of the building
being a barber’s, but it came upon my Lord of Dunbarr’s loosing
3,000<i>l.</i> at one sitting, whereon they said a northerne Lord was
shaved there; but now, putting both togeather, I feare it will be
a nickname of the place, as Nicke and Frothe is at Petworth, so
long as the house stands. My Lord Chamberlain knows not of it
yett, but will chafe abominably when he comes to know it. My
neighbours at Salisbury House are all gone to Hatfield.—Dom.
Ser. St. Pap. Car. I, 323 (41).</p>
</div>

<p>The barber was Simon Osbaldistone, servant to Philip,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
Earl of Pembroke and Montgomery, Chamberlain of the
Royal Household.</p>

<p>Clarendon, in “The History of the Rebellion,” mentions
the place:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mr. Hyde going to a House called Piccadilly, which was a fair
house for entertainment and gaming, with handsome gravel walks
with shade, and where is an upper and lower bowling green,
whither many of the best quality resorted for exercise and recreation.</p>
</div>

<p>A description of the building is found in an estimate of
1650.</p>

<p>Mr. H. B. Wheatley in “Round about Piccadilly” gives
a full account of the later fortunes of Piccadilly. “The
house commonly called Pickadilly House” was assigned as
soldiers’ quarters on 1 August 1650 (“Interregnum Order-Book”).
Faithorne’s map (1658) shows it as “The Gaming
House.” Evelyn mentions the locality in his “Diary” (1662)
saying that “orders had been given to pave the way from
St. James’s North, which was a Quagmire, and the Haymarket,
and Piquadillo.” Colonel Thomas Panton seems to
have purchased it in 1671, and petitioned for leave to build
on it, which was granted.</p>

<p>All this throws very little light on the derivation of the
name, except that it dissociates it from “the gallants of
the gaming house,” which was not built until Piccadilloes
were out of fashion. Among the annals of 1612 we find
mention of “yellow starch, and great cut-work bands and
piccadillies (things that hath since lost the name),” said to
have been imported or contrived by the notorious Mrs.
Turner (Kennet’s “England,” ii, 638). Barnabe Rich in his
“Honesty of the Age,” 1614, satirizing the tailors and
“body-makers,” says, “he that some forty or fifty years
sithens should have asked after a Pickadilly, I wonder who,
could have understood him, or could have told what a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
Pickadilly had been, either fish or flesh.” Ben Jonson, in
undated lines in “Underwoods,” says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And then leap mad on a neat Pickardill.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In 1615 the Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge promulgated
an injunction against excess in apparel and the use of
“strange peccadillies”; and in that same year, “4th November,
1615, Mrs. Anne Turner, who was executed at
Tyburne, for poysoning of Sir Thomas Overbury, Knight,
was buried at St. Martin’s,” and the churchwardens received
17<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for her grave. An effort to discredit her invention
was made by “hanging her in yellow ruffles,” and
the piccadillies shortly went out of fashion too.</p>

<p>Butler in his “Hudibras” styles the collars of the pillory
“Peccadilloes.” Cotgrave, 1611; Minsheu, 1627; Nares’s
“Old Glossary,” Blunt’s “Glossographia,” 1656, explain the
word as a stiff collar or hem round a garment.</p>

<p>Seeing that Robert Baker was originally a tailor, it is
quite possible that his aristocratic neighbours threw scorn
on his ambitious house by nicknaming it after his collars
“Pickadilly Hall,” a possibility supported by Garrard’s
letter. But there is another possibility which I may suggest.
Seeing that it was in the immediate neighbourhood of
“Swanne Close,” held by the Earl of Salisbury, and seeing
that the district was marshy, full of ditches, and pools
formed in old gravel pits, it is just possible that a breed of
plebeian ducks throve there. Down to the present time
children in East Essex, calling these to their meals, cry,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">Cud, Cud, Cud, Pick a dilly, dilly, dilly,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">which words are probably a survival of the old original of
the mocking parody “Dilly Dilly, come and be killed.” It
is also possible that some specimens of dill, or of daffodils,
frequently called dillies, grew there abundantly. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
churchwardens’ clerk of St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields, in early
years, carefully dissociated the parts of the word as “Pick
a dilly.” It remains at least a fact for us that the word
as a place name first enters literature associated neither
with collars, tailors, nor gaming-houses, but with the botanist
John Gerard, who found the blue buglosse “growing
in a dry Ditch at Pickadilla” some time before 1633.</p>

<p>The important historical information given in the
accounts of the Churchwardens justifies the reproduction
of those selections which testify to the rapid changes
in religion and education. William Russell and Thomas
Cloudesley were churchwardens from 2nd June 1530 till
11th May 1532, and they “Payd for a Prick Song book xxᵈ.”
The next Wardens “payd for the covering of the Pryksong
book ijˢ.” Thurston Amere and William Combes 1538-40,
in their “first yere” “payd for a book to registre in the
names of the Buryalls Weddynges and Cristeninges ijˢ.”
This entry is exceedingly interesting for many reasons.
Archbishop Cranmer and Thomas Cromwell issued a set
of Injunctions dated 11th October 1538; of which a contemporary
copy is preserved in the Public Record Office,
(uncalendared Papers of Henry VIII, 253). The second of
these ordained</p>

<p>St. Margaret’s is one of the few churches whose Registers
are preserved from this early date. This entry proves
promptness in obedience, as the books themselves show
carefulness in preserving. In their second year these
Wardens “payd for the halfe parte of the Bybell accordingly

King’s most honourable Chamber,” wardens from 1540 to
1542; in relation to pew-letting mentions “the purchase of
a book for the pewes of freemen xiᵈ.” Passing over the
regular items of quires of paper for their “particular

help “in the writing of the same; in the Accompte of John

<p>Among the heterogeneous papers of the Court of
Requests are preserved a few which remain of general
importance.</p>

<p>A complaint was made on 25th June, 2 James I, by “the
Governors, Assistants, and Society of the City of London,
of and for the Mineral and Battery Works,” which gives
interesting details as to the advance of science, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
progress of manufactures at that time. It is stated that
the late Queen Elizabeth had been told by William Humphrey,
Saymaster of the Mint in the Tower, that by great
efforts he had induced</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p0">one Christopher Shutz, now deceased, an Almaine, born at
St. Annen Burgh, under the obedience of the Elector of Saxony,
a workmaster of great conning, knowledge and experience, as
well in the finding of the Calamine Stone, called in Latin <i>Lapis
Calaminaris</i>, and in the proper use thereof, and in the mollifying
and manuring of Iron and Steele and drawing and forging the
same into Wyer and plates for the making of armour, and for
divers other necessary and profitable uses, to come over with him
to this country.</p>
</div>

<p>The Queen, through her good hope in the possible success
of this enterprise under Shutz, granted letters patent at
Westminster, dated 17th September, 7 Eliz., giving full power
to the said William Humphrey and Christopher Shutz, their
deputies, servants, and workmen,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p0">to search, dig, mine for the Calamine Stone and all kinds of
Battery wares, to make cast-worke and wyer of Lattin, Iron, Steel,
and Battery, to manure and work into all manner of plate and
wyer,</p>
</div>

<p class="p0">to their own profit for ever. And they were allowed to
build any houses suitable for their work, at their own cost
and charges, on her royal property or the property of any
of her subjects, without any let or hindrance, with various
other powers, privileges, and immunities for raising sufficient
stock, for building of watercourses, for provision of
wood and coal, paying wages and buying tools, and other
things necessary. William Humphrey and Christopher
Shutz gave concessions of shares to others, and these were,
by another royal patent, incorporated into a company by
the name of “the Governors, Assistants, and Society of
the Mineral and Battery Works.” It seemed to have succeeded.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
The Right Hon. William, the late Earl of Worcester,
owned lands in Tintern and Chapelhill, co. Monmouth,
with divers houses built thereon, and in 29 Eliz., in
consideration of a large sum of money paid as a fine, he
leased them to the Society for twenty-one years by a legal
deed, which might be renewed. This included all the
edifices in the parish of Chapelhill, in the lordship of Tintern,
co. Monmouth, that were erected, or would be erected
for their works; also as much as they required of the
stream called Angewe Brook, with the waters, watercourses,
banks, dams, walls, fences, and enclosures for its
necessary course to the houses and buildings. The land
extended from the Tryenbridge to the meadow then in the
tenure of John Edwyn <i>alias</i> Barbor and Margaret his wife,
and so much of the old ditch or watercourse which was
digged to convey water out of the brook to the mill that
sometime stood within the walls or precincts of Tintern
Abbey, and all the banks and enclosures of this old ditch
from the beginning of the old issue out of Angewe Brook
to where the Barbor’s hedge crossed the ditch, and the
new ditch made lately to bring the water back to Angewe
Brook, as far as it led to Tryenbridge, with free ingress
and egress, liberty to dig, to convey away, and to make
water passages for their use. The only rights reserved
to the Earl were the woods and mines on the estate; all
other rights were transferred to the Company, it paying
£4 a year as rent, and rendering certain services to the
lord.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>They reminded King James that he had renewed the
patent on 22nd January last past, and signified his royal
pleasure that he would grant a new and more effective
patent, and no one should interfere with the Company.
They set to work 600 poor people on the spot, and helped
20,000 others of the people. Notwithstanding this, one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
John Phillipps and Gwenllian his wife, late wife of Thomas
Welsh <i>alias</i> Irish, deceased, of Chapelhill,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p0">being riotous and outrageous and evil disposed persons, and intending
the let and hindrance of the wire works at Tintern, the
utter undoing of the poor people therein working, and the disturbance
of the Company in its quiet proceedings, having gotten
into their hands the deeds of the lease made by the Earl and
other deeds belonging to the Company, have made forcible entry
by outrageous means, as by throwing of scalding water, and with
spits and other desperate weapons have forced out and kept out
the Company’s workmen out of their working places, and houses
built upon the ground for them</p>
</div>

<p class="p0">by the plaintiffs’ predecessors, to their great loss. These
defendants also</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p0">stop the watercourses which issue from these works and work-houses,
so that the wheels of the other houses are so drowned in
water they cannot turn. This is to the great impoverishment of
the poor workmen and the many thousands who live by working
the wire to divers uses, which is first made by these workmen. If
these defendants are allowed to continue their oppressions, it will
become a general harm to the whole dominion, for many depend
on wire to make woolcards and many other things of great necessity,
which cannot elsewhere be so plentifully had, except from
foreign parts.</p>
</div>

<p>In tender consideration of their difficulties, seeing they
cannot sue at common law because they have not the lease
granted them by the Earl, and do not remember the exact
dates, and also for the present necessity of the continuance
and daily keeping up of the wire works and poor people at
work, and as the action of the defendants is an intolerable
offence not only to the plaintiffs, but to the commonwealth,
and work may not be stayed or hindered a week without
great loss all round; they therefore pray a privy seal to be
sent to John Phillipps and Gwenllian his wife to appear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
immediately, and also an injunction to them to stop all
their proceedings until they have answered this complaint.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the rest of the suit is not to hand, and
we have no “answer,” “replication,” or “depositions” to
supply further details, but they may be found yet. Meanwhile
Dr. Owen might turn his researches to a practical
use and excavate the site—perhaps even find the Company’s
books, with the name of Bacon as a shareholder,
a little further up the Wye, where the Anjou Brook
enters it.</p>

IMPRESO”</span></h2></div>


<p>Mr. Stevenson’s discovery among the lately
calendared Belvoir MSS. of an apparent reference
to the poet stirred the Shakespearean world. It encouraged
us in the hope that somehow, somewhere, we might some
day discover more important facts; but nevertheless it
puzzled us. It did not quite seem to fit into the known
facts of the poet’s career. There is an indefiniteness, too,
about the wording of this entry which makes it different
from the ordinary records of the Steward’s book of payments.
It is not “for,” but “<i>about</i> an Impreso.” There is
no suggestion of the material on or in which the device
was worked, nor whether the idea, complete in some
material, or only the design of it, was referred to.</p>

<p>The impresa was a private and personal device, as distinguished
from the family coat of arms, and was especially
used in tournaments and masques when there was some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
attempt at concealing one’s identity. A coat of arms told
a man’s name as clearly as written or spoken words; an
impresa, especially when used for the first time, would be
known only to the intimate personal friends of the wearer.</p>

<p>The Belvoir impresa of 1613 was about to be used for
the first time. Roger, Earl of Rutland, who, in company
with the Earl of Southampton, in 1599 “went not to the
Court, but only to see plays every day,” had died, and had
been succeeded by his brother Francis, who was now preparing
for a Court tournament.</p>

<p>There is nothing surprising in the poet’s being employed
by the Earl of Rutland, nor in his being able to design a
device, nor even in his using his hands in fashioning it.
His association with Burbage seems to strengthen the fact.
The players of the day knew about preparations for festivities,
and all the Burbages seem to have been handy men.
We know that the poet was interested in heraldry through
the Sonnets and the plays, as well as through his method
of securing arms for himself.</p>

<p>The Steward’s account in which the reference to Shakespeare
occurs runs as follows:</p>

</div>

<p>The name of Shakespeare does not occur again, but,
curiously enough, another entry shows Richard Burbage
at similar work, at a time very near the close of the poet’s
life:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>25 Martii, 1616. Given to Richard Burbidge for my Lorde’s
shelde, and for the embleance, iiii<i>li</i>. xviii<i>s.</i></p>
</div>

<p>It seemed quite clear that the above entry referred to
the poet, and yet many students have an uneasy sense of
dissatisfaction, and I have been tempted to mention two
alternative theories. The money that was paid him “about
my Lord’s impreso” might have been paid him to convey
to some one else; or the entry might refer to another
“Mr. Shakspeare” altogether. There was one in London
at the time. A John Shakspeare married Mary Gooderidge
in St. Clement Danes on 3rd February 1604-5. He was a
fashionable bit-maker, was in the royal service, and might
well be called “Mr.” by the Belvoir Steward. He was
probably master of the Loriners’ Company, though we
cannot be sure of this, as the early books of the guild are
lost. But we know that in St. Clement Danes he was
buried: “John Shackespeare, the King’s Bitmaker, 27 Jan.,
1633”; and that the King was indebted to him at his death
to the extent of £1,692 11<i>s.</i> (See my “Shakespeare’s
Family,” p. 147.)</p>

<p>Many entries of payments to him are recorded in the

many that I can only here give limited selections.</p>

<p>At the end of the accounts are “abatements” of many

either charged fair prices, or had special Court favour.</p>

<p>The Earl of Northampton gives his accounts in a great

workman, referring to the special books. In this occur the
name of John Shakespeare and the amount of his bills; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
it seems unnecessary to do more than give the reference—Exchequer
Q.R. 436 (3). Collier noted some of the entries.</p>

<p>With all this special work on lines associated with
tournaments, it is evidently <i>possible</i> that John Shakespeare
might be the person referred to in the Belvoir accounts.
As there is more than a possibility that this John is the
cousin who disappears from Snitterfield, the association
with Burbage may be naturally explained. I have not
made up my own mind upon the subject, but so many
have asked me to put forward the facts that I thought it
wise to do so. If there is nothing more in them, they at
least prove that there was another contemporary and well-to-do
“Mr. Shakespeare” in Court service, engaged in
work which might have suggested employment “about my
Lorde’s impreso.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXIII">XXIII<br><span class="small">“THE QUEEN’S PLAYERS” IN 1536</span></h2></div>


<p>Dramatic records of Henry VIII’s reign are very
scarce, and therefore it may be of interest to some
students to have the text of a little Chancery suit to which
I was guided through the studies of Mr. J. S. Young. It is
undated by the scribe, but a proximate date may be
reckoned. The appeal was addressed to “Sir Thomas
Awdley,” who was appointed Chancellor in 1533, and he
was made Lord Audley of Walden, 29th November 1538.
The complaint states that the company were Queen Jane’s
players, “late her servants.” As she was married only in
June 1536, and as the cause of the dispute was referred
back to “a year and three quarters past,” and she died in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
1537, the complaint must have been brought just before
the Chancellor was ennobled in 1538.</p>

<p>The document does not tell us much. It only gives the
names of the chief members of the company as John
Young, John Sly, David Sotherne, and John Mountfield
(names that appear in the Lord Chamberlain’s books); and
shows that they had been travelling professionally in “the
northern parts,” and came to trouble over their packhorse.</p>

<p>The only earlier notice of “the Queen’s company” was
in 1532, when it must have been Queen Katherine’s, whose
waning power may have accounted for the trifling reward
at Oxford “given to her players by the President’s orders,”
viz. 12<i>d.</i> (E. K. Chambers, ii, 249.)</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXIV">XXIV<br><span class="small">MARY’S CHAPEL ROYAL AND HER
CORONATION PLAY</span></h2></div>


<p>No previous sovereign had made on his coronation so
sudden and complete a change in the Chapel Royal
of his predecessor as Mary did. The Bishop of Norwich
was the Dean; six priests replaced so many clerks and
gentlemen; little boys to bear censers and crosses were
introduced; the communion table became the altar once
more; the English service was replaced by the Latin; the
metrical Psalms were banished, and the old Psalters and
Antiphonals took their place. Doubtless to the gentlemen
of the Chapel who had taken the oath of fealty this latter
change was welcome, from the Psalms sung in unison (for
there is no mention of Crowley’s four parts having been
used at Court) to the richer harmonies and more “curious”
music of the old service. But Mary’s changes marked
conservative, not revolutionary, ideas. She never thought
her young brother old enough to understand or to judge
for himself in matters of such great moment, and she
wanted to conform to the customs of her progenitors on
their accession in so far as she could.</p>

<p>Therefore, among other things, she ordered a play to be
performed at her Coronation, and the “gentlemen of the
Chapel Royal,” as was their wont, were to perform it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile her poet, whoever he was, must have taken
his cue from a general caution. On 16th August the Privy
Council prepared a “Proclamation for reformation of busy
medlers in matters of religion, and for redresse of Prechers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
printers, players.” This was printed<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> and circulated on
18th August, and treated of “the playing of Interludes and
printing of false fond bookes, ballettes, rhymes, and other
lewde treatises in the English tongue concerning matters
now in Question and controversy.” No one was to play
an interlude without the Queen’s licence in writing.
Collier, “History of the Stage,” i, 154, says that “a play
had been ordered on the occasion of her coronation, which,
we may presume, was performed by the gentlemen of the
Chapel.” But he says no more. Stowe does not further
allude to it, and the name of the play is not known.
Others state that it was postponed until Christmas. Therefore
it is of some importance that certain definite facts
should be recorded and preserved concerning it. Apparently
the play <i>was</i> performed by the gentlemen of the Chapel,
and their dresses, which had probably been prepared before,
were given out to them on 30th September.</p>

</div>

<p>Among the old plays which have come down to us,
either in print or in manuscript, I cannot find any which
would fit this cast. It could not have been “The Castle of
Perseverance,” as Humanum Genus there enters as a
child, and except the “good and bad angel,” the characters
are all different; nor the other allegory called by Collier
“Mankind,” which gives Mercy, New Guise, and Now-a-days,
Mischief, Nought, etc. Nor could it have been “Respublica,”
said to have been made in the year 1553, 1 Mary,
and to have been played before the Queen. The Prologue
is spoken by the author himself in the character of the
Poet, and the other characters are Respublica (England),
Authority, Policy, Oppression, Avarice, Insolence, Adulation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
Nemesis, Misericordia, Justitia, Honesty, Pax, People.
Nor could it have been the old play of Nature and Reason;
nor the Interlude of Youth. So it may be reckoned as an
interlude of which neither the name nor the text is as yet
known, but it may some day be discovered through this
cast. Of its plot we may at least guess that it would be
in supposed prophetic relation to the Queen’s reign, and
that all the good characters would triumph over the bad.
Of its author no clue has as yet been found.</p>

<p>John Heywood was an interlude writer of the time,
formerly a singing gentleman in the Chapel, and jester to
Queen Mary. Udall had written plays, and various
scholars of the universities had tried their hands. It might
have been put together by one of these, or by one of the
gentlemen of the Chapel: Richard Farrant, afterwards
Master of the Children of Windsor, is known to have written
interludes, and so is William Hunnis, author of many pieces
in “The Paradise of Dainty Devises,” and many religious
poems in the following reign, when he was also the Master
of the Children of the Chapel Royal, and designer of the
great festivities at Kenilworth, 1575. His friend Thomas
Newton writes of him that in the prime of youth he had
written besides “sonets sweete,” also “interludes and gallant
lays,” which have not come down to us.</p>

<p>If we do not know the author, there is a good deal to
learn about the actors. From the “Order of the Royal
Household of Edward IV” we know their necessary qualifications
and duties, not their numbers; for while there
were twenty gentlemen and eight children in Henry VIII’s
time, in Edward’s they were raised to thirty-two gentlemen
and twelve children, a number kept up by Mary.
From the royal warrants to the Keeper of the Great
Wardrobe we know that they all had new liveries for the
Coronation. A further warrant for new surplices includes
several other small items for chapel use, and a list of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
names of the gentlemen. As there is no list previous to
1561 printed, except that of Hawkins and Burney in their
“History of Music,” without date, and with the hazy reference
to “A MS. in the British Museum,” which has thus
indefinitely been followed by all musical writers and by
Rimbault in his “Cheque-Book of the Chapel Royal,” it
will be as well to print this duly authenticated list here.
One referring to the mourning for Edward VI appeared
in “Archaeologia.” I have found three others at the
British Museum with definite references and one at the
Society of Antiquaries, but none of them agrees exactly
with that of Hawkins and Burney, the original of which
has yet to be found.</p>

<p>It may be noted that there are only thirty-one instead
of thirty-two. It is possible that one has been accidentally
omitted, probably John Lucam, yeoman; or some one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
may have refused even then to take the oath of allegiance.
Several other names appear in other lists. Every one of
these, in his day, must have been of some note.</p>

<p>The Chapel Royal was the haven of the best musical
talent of the day. Every music lover knows of Shepherd,
Tallis, Farrant; and Marbeck’s service was harmonized by
these in conjunction with some of the minor names above.
Thomas Byrde was the father of William Byrde, the pupil
and associate of Tallis. Thomas Palfreyman was a well-known
writer on moral philosophy, as well as a musician.</p>

<p>We have no clue to the names of the twenty-three performers
selected from these, either for their fitness, or as a
special mark of honour. Richard Bowyer was the Master of
the Children then, William Hunnis and Richard Farrant
were Masters of the Children afterwards, so these three
would probably have definite histrionic powers. Of their
appearance we know little. We only know of one of them,
William Hunnis, that he was a very handsome young man,
as this is stated in the examinations of the prisoners at
the Tower in 1556.</p>

<p>As to the day and hour of the performance, there is no
definite information. John Stow mentions that during her
progress from the Tower to Westminster on Saturday
30th September</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At Fanchurch was a costly pageant made by the Genouwayes,
at Grace Church Corner there was another pageant made by the
Easterlings. At the upper end of Grace Street there was another
pageant very high, made by the Florentines.... One other
pageant at the little conduit in Cheape next to Paul’s, made by
the Cittie, where the Aldermen stood ... and in Paul’s Churchyard,
against the school, one Master Haywood sate in a pageant
under a Vine, and made unto her an oration in Latin and English.</p>
</div>

<p>It may be remembered that it was <i>after</i> she reached
Westminster in the afternoon that she signed the warrant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
for the dresses. After the Coronation services in the Abbey
on Sunday, which are of course well known, came the Coronation
feast, the details of which are not so well known, and
are worth recording. “She was conveyed in goodly order
unto Westmynster Hall to dinner” (Cotton MS., App. xxviii,
24). In MS. 34, 320, f. 97, Brit. Mus., we find the</p>

<div class="blockquot">

</div>

<p>The food served at these five boards is most remarkable,
and accounts for a considerable part of the levy of £20,000
which Mary made on the City of London. To note it all
would take too much space, but the Queen’s dinner is really
too interesting to pass. In the same MS. (f. 86) we find:</p>

</div>

<p>Apparently each of these was reduplicated three times,
except the subtleties; and the three “messes” seem to
have been one for the Queen, one for the Bishop (<i>i.e.</i>, of
Winchester, who had crowned her that day) and one for
the two ladies who sat at her board. That this distinction
was carried out may be inferred from the following note:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>Servers.</i><br>
<br>
The Earl of Sussex for the Queen.<br>
Sir Humphrey Ratcliffe for the Bishop.<br>
Sir Anthony Browne for the Ladies.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>The most noticeable peculiarity beyond its variety is the
apparent setting on of salt and sweet together which is
still a custom in Eastern feasts, and the making a second
and a third course, as of another complete dinner, also of salt
and sweet dishes. The crown of each was the “Subtelty,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
a comparatively artistic design in jelly and candied sugar,
something like a modern trifle, but always utilized for bearing
the motto of the feast, and consequently it was probably
the last to be demolished. No wines are mentioned in this
manuscript. It must have taken a long time even to eat a
morsel of each selection.</p>

<p>And after the feast was over would come into the hall,
as was the custom with her progenitors, the gentlemen of
her Chapel Royal and perform their play about Humankind
and the good and bad angels. The customary prayer
for the Queen by the performers, would close the proceedings.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXV">XXV<br><span class="small">SIR ANDREW DUDLEY AND LADY MARGARET
CLIFFORD, 1553</span></h2></div>


<p>The Dudley, who with Empson, served Henry VII
rather too eagerly in filling the coffers of the State,
was sacrificed in the first year of Henry VIII to the resentment
of the people. He left three sons, John, Andrew, and
Jerome, plain Dudleys. The aspiring ambitions of the
eldest were successful beyond his early hopes, and he had
worked himself up through all the grades of nobility to
the highest place, and greatest power in the land, by the
first half of 1553.</p>

<p>The Dudleys were a united family, both through affection
and common interests, and John helped his brother Andrew
as much as he could, to add to his own strength in Edward’s
reign. So plain Andrew Dudley was made Admiral of the
Fleet of the North on 27th February 1546-7, and knighted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
shortly afterwards. He was also made Keeper of Westminster
Palace, October 1560, Master of the Robes, and
Captain of Guisnes. He did not share in the greater
honours the Privy Councillors bestowed on each other on
11th October 1551, when his brother John, then Earl of
Warwick, was made Duke of Northumberland. But in
1552-3 Sir Andrew Dudley was made Knight of the Garter,
and it became evident that his elder brother meant to
shower more honours on him should he himself be successful
in his skilfully prepared <i>coup d’état</i>. An old Earl of
Warwick had been surnamed “the Kingmaker”; this
Dudley, Earl of Warwick and Duke of Northumberland,
might have been surnamed <i>the Queenmaker</i>. By a curious
coincidence, all the possible heirs to the throne at that
time were women. Northumberland arranged to set aside
the will of Henry VIII, in so far as it affected the succession
of Mary and Elizabeth, on the ground that their father
had determined their illegitimacy in Acts of Parliament
which had never been repealed; he followed that will in
excluding from succession the Scottish Queen, and he persuaded
Edward VI to make a will for himself settling the
crown on the heirs of his Aunt Mary, Duchess of Suffolk,
younger sister of Henry VIII. Mary had left two daughters,
Frances, now Duchess of Suffolk, and Ellinor, late Countess
of Cumberland. It has never been explained how Northumberland
managed to persuade the Duchess of Suffolk to
allow herself to be passed over during her lifetime. But
he arranged it somehow, that her eldest daughter, the Lady
Jane Grey, should be the chosen heir to Edward’s throne.
When he thought he had settled this, he married the Lady
Jane to his eldest unmarried son, the Lord Guilford Dudley,
and gave her two younger sisters to his friends. The story
of the disasters brought thereby on all concerned is universally
known.</p>

<p>But it is not so well known that Northumberland’s far-reaching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
vision had seen and settled with further possible
royal successions, and he betrothed his brother Andrew to
the sole daughter and heir of Ellinor, Countess of Cumberland.
The bare fact is mentioned in the D.N.B., and in
some other authorities (not in all). A hitherto unnoted suit
has turned up at the Record Office among the uncalendared
proceedings of the Court of Requests of Elizabeth, which
provides much fuller tragi-romantical details. This is a
suit instituted by Sir Robert Dudley, afterwards Earl of
Leicester, to secure possession of all his uncle Andrew’s
goods, as executor of his will. Ellinor, daughter of Mary,
Duchess of Suffolk, had married Henry Clifford, 2nd Earl
of Cumberland; and it says much for the power and influence
of the Duke of Northumberland in 1553 that he
should have made the noble Earl content to give his
well-dowered daughter Margaret, great-granddaughter of
Henry VII, to a middle-aged landless knight, a widower
to boot. The fair young girl, if the D.N.B. is correct in
the date of her birth (which it gives as 1540), would be but
thirteen years old, though it seems from her examinations
later, she was a year or two older. The inclination of the
lady is nowhere referred to. It is barely possible there
may have been some feelings of affection between the
apparently incongruous pair. She may have</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Loved him for the dangers he had passed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And he loved her that she did pity them.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They were duly betrothed, and arrangements proceeded.
The earliest preserved reference is in “A Warrant to Sir
Andrew Dudley, as Master of the Wardrobe, to take for
the Lady Margaret Clifford, daughter to the Earl of Cumberland,
and to himself for their wedding apparel, sundry
silks and jewels, 8th June, 7 Ed. VI, 1553, M. S. Reg. 18,
cxxiv. f. 364.”</p>

<p>On 12th June of the same year a letter was dictated by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
Privy Council in favour of Sir Andrew Dudley, concerning
a marriage to be concluded “at the King’s request,” but the
address is not given in the register. So by the middle of
June 1553, Sir Andrew Dudley was gaily preparing for his
wedding with the second cousin of the King, a girl who, by
the new scheme of the succession, stood next in the line of
inheritance of the throne after the Lady Jane Grey and her
two sisters.</p>

<p>The Earl of Cumberland had shunned Court life since
the death of his wife Ellinor, and had lived with his young
daughter at Skipton Castle, in Craven, Yorkshire. He was
loth to part with his daughter, even had Sir Andrew had
a suitable home to which to take her. Therefore it had
been arranged that the bride and bridegroom should reside
with the Earl at Skipton, at least for a time. Sir Andrew
sent rich gifts of jewels and clothing, collected all his best
plate and furniture, and even borrowed some from his friends
to adorn the suite of rooms they should dwell in. He seems
to have had faithful and capable servants. Oswald Wilkinson,
of the city of York, had been gentleman porter at
Guisnes when Sir Andrew was in command there; he left
when his master left, and followed him to Ireland, where
he served him during the last year of Edward VI. And
now Sir Andrew sent this trusty servant in charge with
sixteen or seventeen others to convey his treasures north
to his bride. Among other things there were:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Three cupboards furnished with plate, with a garnish of vessels
silver gilt, a Venetian cup with a cover pounced, a salt with
certain stones set therein, and one or two pieces of small plate
which were thought to be all pure gold.... Also much goodly
apparel, both for him and for her, three or more suits apiece, two
of them of gold and silver tinsel, the rest of velvet and satin, with
buttons and aglets of gold. As for money, none went with them,
save a little purse of gold and silver strange coins, in value about
£10.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span></p>

<p>Oswald Wilkinson and Alexander Harrison were present at
the unpacking, and thought the things would be worth at
least £3,000. Wilkinson made two copies of the inventory,
with rough valuation, in the presence of Lady Margaret
Clifford, Lady Conyers, Sir Ingram Clifford, James Banks
and William Danby, gentleman servants to the Earl, and
Mrs. Brograve, gentlewoman to Lady Margaret. Wilkinson
signed one of the inventory-books, and gave it to the
Lady Margaret, she signed the other, and gave it to him
to keep till his master came. The Lady waited for her
Lord in the Northern Tower, with the keys of the plate
cupboards, the clothes chests, and the jewel coffers in her
pocket, while the faithful henchman of her future husband
kept the keys of the treasure chamber. They seem to have
remained at Skipton nearly three weeks, during the first
part of which time Sir Andrew was winding up his affairs,
realizing his money, and preparing to follow his wedding
gifts to his future home.</p>

<p>But the young King died too soon; too soon for Northumberland,
for he had not yet had the Royal Will ratified
by his submissive Parliament; too soon for Sir Andrew, for
he had not yet wed his lady. Edward’s death was concealed
from the outer world for a day or two, while Northumberland
and the Council prepared their plans. Then followed
an anxious week for the country. But in Skipton Castle
there was a special dread. New rulers had sometimes a way
of getting rid of collateral connections.</p>

<p>Northumberland and the Council proclaimed the Lady
Jane as Queen, and arranged that the Duke of Suffolk
should go forth to deal with Mary. But the only Royal
action the poor little Queen Jane was ever allowed to do
of her own free will, was to insist that her father should
stay with her in the Tower, a decision by which she helped
to save his life in the first instance. So Northumberland
perforce had to go himself, and all his family supported<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
him. He got as far as Cambridge, his forces deserting as
he went. The unexpected courage of Mary, the ready
response it met, turned the tide of events. The Council he
had left behind him in London, bound with an oath to Jane,
proclaimed Mary. Northumberland tried to save himself
also by proclaiming her in Cambridge. But he was too
late. All the Dudley family were arrested, Sir Andrew
among them, so he never reached his bride and his treasure
waiting for him in Skipton Tower, but was hurried to the
Tower of London, in by the Traitor’s Gate.</p>

<p>The Earl of Cumberland had been sitting on the fence.
When he heard that Mary had been proclaimed in York,
he dropped on the safe side, and to show his love and
loyalty took the keys of her treasures from his fair daughter,
the keys of the chamber from Dudley’s servants, with both
the inventories, and took possession of the property in the
name of Queen Mary!</p>

<p>No affronted Sovereign, backed by her people, could
afford to pass by treason so determined. Northumberland
and some of his chief supporters fell at once. The Baga
de Secretis records, under the date of 19th August 1553, the
attainder of Sir Ambrose Dudley, Henry Dudley, Esquire,
Sir Andrew Dudley, Sir John and Sir Henry Gate, “for
levying war against the Queen, and asserting the title of
the Lady Jane on the 18th and 19th July, and for taking
their way towards Framlingham Castle, to deprive the
Queen of her Royal Dignity.” They were all condemned.
But Mary was wonderfully merciful. She pardoned the
Dudleys, she even released the Duke of Suffolk, father of
her rival, because confinement did not agree with his
health.</p>

<p>There was an investigation into the traitors’ goods.
Oswald Wilkinson was sent to the Tower, on the charge of
carrying his master’s goods to Skipton, and he was kept
there till the inventories were sent for and gone into. Early<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
in 1554 Sir Andrew Dudley “was created loyal subject,
and enabled to take, receive, and enjoy all manner of gifts
of land, goods, and household stuff henceforth to him
given.” That was cold comfort to a man past his prime,
now without place or influence or friends to give him aught.
And he wanted his bride. He sent up humble petitions for
relief. By-and-by, “the King and Queen, moved with pity,
by their letters patent under the Great Seal, granted him
all such goods and chattels as had belonged to him on the
22nd July, 1553,” which had afterwards belonged to the
King and Queen, and gave him full power and authority
“to prosecute all actions or suits or executions concerning
the goods, money, debts, against all and every person
deteyning them, and in peace quietly to have and enjoy
them, as if Sir Andrew Dudley had never been attainted of
treason.” But this concession came too late.</p>

<p>We must turn back to note what the Cliffords had been
doing. Sir Andrew being in the Tower, the Earl of Cumberland
came to London, and handed over his Collar of the
Garter into the Queen’s own hands, and some other jewels
to the Queen’s Commissioners, Lord Rich and Mr. Potts,
and on 6th September 1553, it was agreed that the Earl
should keep the rest of Sir Andrew’s goods, on paying
£500 into the Exchequer. Mary was very cordial to the
Earl, but warned him that he must not marry his daughter
except to one approved of by herself. It would almost
seem that she suggested Henry, Lord Strange, son and
heir of the Earl of Derby. At least the smiles of royalty
brightened this wedding. The Queen presented the bride
with a brooch of thirteen diamonds, all the household linen,
and all the robes which had belonged to Sir Andrew
Dudley. It is probable the Lady Margaret Clifford wore
at her marriage to Lord Strange on 7th February 1554-5,
the very robes of gold and silver tinsel Sir Andrew had
received from the Royal wardrobe for his own intended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
wedding in June 1553. The Queen made a great feast at
Court on the occasion of the marriage. There were jousts,
in which King Philip himself took part, and “after supper
there was the Juego de Cañas,” a Spanish game, in which
he led. The Queen was anxious, a presentiment of evil
weighed her down, and she more than once sent to beg the
King not to expose himself so much. Her suspicion of a
lurking danger was well founded. There was already widespread
discontent with the Spanish marriage, the religious
severities had increased this, and on the 4th of February,
only three days before this gay wedding, John Rogers, the
first Marian martyr, had been burned at the stake amid the
murmurs of the people. The State Papers tell us that a
secret band of conspirators had appointed William Hunnis,
Allday, Cornwall, and others to the number of twelve, to
kill the King, and after him the Queen, that very night.
But though these elements of danger mingled in the gay
crowd nothing was done. “A cautious consideration of the
risks run by themselves put the conspirators out of stomach
for the enterprise.” So the Lady Margaret Clifford was
safely married to the Catholic Lord Strange; and after the
festivities were all over the Queen’s pity turned to her
former <i>fiancé</i>, and he was made capable of holding property
and demanding debts. The first thing he did was to send
his former servant, Alexander Harrison, to York to meet
Oswald Wilkinson, and go with him to Skipton Castle to
demand back his (Sir Andrew’s) wedding provision. But
the Earl refused unless they paid him £500. They had it
not to pay. The Earl refused even to give them some
necessary pieces of plate for Sir Andrew’s use, worth in
all about £40, which they earnestly requested. Poor Sir
Andrew never saw either his bride or his property again.
He was in a sad plight. He had lost all Court influence
through his brother’s death, he was not so young or so
astute as his nephews. He became suspected of being concerned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
in the plot held together by John Throckmorton,
the Ashtons, and Henry Dudley (not his nephew). He
might have sympathized with it, but nothing was proved
against him. After a year filled with trials and executions
in connection with this conspiracy Sir Andrew Dudley fell
ill. He thought he was going to die, and made his will on
21st July 1556, leaving many legacies to be paid out of
debts due to him, and appointing as overseers his nephews,
Ambrose, afterwards Earl of Warwick, Robert, afterwards
Earl of Leicester, and Henry, not the conspirator. The
broken man did not then die. A new path to promotion
might have been found for him in the new reign, through
his nephews. But he died in the first year of Elizabeth at
Westminster. His will was proved on 22nd November 1559,
by Sir Robert Dudley. Thence arose the suit in the Court
of Requests, which has preserved so many details. Sir
Robert could not settle the legacies without securing the
debts, so he exhibited a Bill of Complaint against the Earl
of Cumberland, the chief debtor. The complaint itself is
lost, but it is easy to reconstruct it (excepting the date) from
the other papers. In an undated answer the Earl denied
that the Lord Robert Dudley had any right to demand
goods lawfully forfeited, minimized the amount and value
of the goods, but acknowledged having:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One purse of 29 pieces of gold and 11 pieces of new money;
divers apparels, as shirtes, petycotes, trusses, doublets of taffaty
and satin, hoses of velvet and saten, jerkyns, clokes, and gowns
of velvet and satin with aglets of gold, jackets of cloth of gold,
cote of silver, velvet, and satin, hankerchers, certain plate double
gilt, parcel gilt, white plate, one cup of gold, and certain pewter
and glass.</p>
</div>

<p>The Queen became possessed of all, kept the jewels, and
bargained the other goods to him for £500, as may be seen
by a privy seal. The Replication of Lord Robert Dudley<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
(also undated) declared the answer insufficient. The Earl
of Cumberland in the first instance was not an official of
the Queen’s, and had no right to seize the goods. They
were not in his keeping, but in the keeping of the Lady
Margaret. He never paid that £500 to the Exchequer, and
had no receipt for it. Dudley was able to prove the goods
were worth £4,500. Sir Andrew had a patent granted him
to sue for all debts.</p>

<p>In the rejoinder the Earl said he knew of Sir Andrew’s
patent, but before it was granted the Queen had seized the
goods, detained some, sent some to the Lady Strange, and
sold the remainder to him for £500. It is true that he did
not pay this directly. But the Lord Strange owed him
£500, and paid it for him. A commission was appointed
to hear witnesses at Westminster, and they heard Lord
Robert Dudley’s on 10th December 1560. The most important
was Oswald Wilkinson, who stated all the facts
above, and added that they could not have altered the
inventory without his knowing it. Thomas Greene, of
Adlyngton, co. Cheshire, another old servant, spoke to
sums of money Sir Andrew had possessed. Alexander
Harrison, while supporting Wilkinson, added that he had
received from Sir Henry Sidney through James Shelley
£1,300 for Sir Andrew Dudley at Petty Callys in Westminster
in the last year of Edward VI. The Earl kept all
the goods and inventories and everything except the four
horses he and his fellows rode on. William Garrat and
William Clark, gentlemen, of Westminster, former servants,
supported the depositions of their fellows, and Hugh
Briscowe had seen the book of payments for all Sir
Andrew’s property, and heard him confess it on his death-bed.
He knew Sir Andrew had sent in a Supplication
against the Earl to the late Queen in the Court of Requests.
John Cogges had packed all the property and had heard
it estimated at £5,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span></p>

<p>The Earl’s witnesses were not examined till 3rd February
1561-2, Christopher Monckton, William Danby, and others,
who really supported Dudley’s witnesses. On the same
day, the 3rd of February 1561-2, the noble witness the Lady
Margaret Strange was called. She gave her age as twenty-four,
and thus the D.N.B. would seem to be out by two
years in the date of her birth. She supported the depositions
of the Dudley servants clearly and fully, and signed
her deposition in her beautiful clear, careful handwriting,
“Margaret Strange.” From the Book of Decrees and
Orders one can gather that some private arrangement was
come to after all. Lord Robert Dudley was becoming ever
more powerful with the Queen, and the Earl of Cumberland
would doubtless have to climb down. And the Lady
Margaret Strange, who was not very happy with her Lord,
became, on his father’s death, the Countess of Derby, survived
her husband, and, it is said, communed with soothsayers,
who promised her that her son should be King.
That son resisted the suggestion, and she saw him struck
down by poison given, it was said, by disappointed Jesuits.
Her second son became Earl, and kept himself safe and
secluded from worldly ambitions, “writing only comedies
for the common players”; and she, out of favour in Elizabeth’s
suspicious Court,<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> because of her dreams of a Royal
succession, ended her life in gloom in 1596. (<i>See</i> Camden’s

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXVI">XXVI<br><span class="small">JANE, THE QUEEN’S FOOL</span></h2></div>


<p>The only woman in this country clearly recorded to
have filled the peculiarly masculine office of the Royal
Fool was a person named Jane, whose paternal name is as
yet only a matter of inference. It is not insignificant that
she flourished in the time of our first Queen Regnant,
1537-1558, coming to the Household while Mary was
Princess, and sharing the days of her adversity, as well as
of her prosperity. It is possible that Mary, with her modest
nature, considered that it would be more decorous that her
quiet household should be amused by a humourist of her
own sex, than by such jesters as awakened by their broad
witticisms roars of laughter in her father’s Court. But it
is more than likely that, from some kind motive at first,
she had extended her protection to Jane as a young girl
left under some peculiar need of help, and, after fitting her
for it, appointed her to the office. No book of Jane’s
witticisms has come down to us, nor any allusions to them,
as in the case of her predecessor Scogan, and her contemporary
Will Somers, so that it is probable that her sayings
were neither very brilliant nor very broad, and that
she was one who rather warmed and illumined life by a
genial humour, than one who flashed upon it startling
coruscations of wit. Dr. Doran, in his “History of Court
Fools,” does not allude to her, though he might have done
so had he studied Sir Frederick Madden’s published transcript
of the household expenses of the Princess Mary, as
Miss Strickland has done to advantage.</p>

<p>Little is known of her except through the accounts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
her garments, and yet through the language of clothes we
find in this case a good deal of information regarding
Court customs and expenditure, and of the Queen who
determined both. In many ways Mary showed herself
liberal by nature, but nowhere more markedly than in the
clothing of her Court Fools. Besides the Girl-Fool of
her youth, the Queen, on coming to the throne, “entertained”
her father’s fool, William Somers, doubtless on
account of his well-known kindly and charitable disposition.
Armin, in his “Nest of Ninnies,” says of him:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He was a poor man’s friend</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And helped the widow often to her end;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The King would ever grant what he did craue,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For well he knew Will no exacting Knave,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But wished the King to do good deeds great store</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which caused the Court to love him more and more.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But though Henry VIII granted his Fool’s requests,
he did not array Somers anything like so handsomely as
Mary did. So it does not seem surprising that she liked to
deck her Woman Fool almost gorgeously at times. One
can only wonder how Jane could wear out all the shoes
that were made for her, unless she had some poor relatives
whom they fitted. The more limited gifts of Mary’s early
days were, no doubt, eked out by home-made “translations,”
and certainly aided by grants from the King. The
earliest entry (Royal MSS. British Museum, 17B. xxviii)
runs: “December 1537. Payd for housen and shewes to
Jane the Foole 20ᵈ.”</p>

<p>In 1538: “Payd for a yerde and a halfe Damaske for
Jane the Fole 7/. Item payed to Mʳˢ Laundress for stuff
by hir bought for Jane the Fole 15/.”</p>

<p>In 1542 appears: “Item for a pair of shews for Jane the
Fole 6/.” In April 1543: “Item for three elles clothe to
make Jane the Fole smocks 3/.” In July 1543: “Item payd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
for Jane the Fole for the tyme of her seekness 22/6.” In
September of that year:</p>

<p>“Payd for a Kirtle for Jane Foole 15/.</p>

<p>“Item for nedles for Jane 1ᵈ.”</p>

<p>In January 1543-4: “Payed for shaving of Jane Fole’s
head 8ᵈ,” an expense which was again incurred in July 1544,
in August and September of that year, as if some weakness
in the hair had followed her severe illness.</p>

<p>In June-1544: “Item for a coffer for Jane the Foole 3/4.”</p>

<p>From another source we find other facts. In 1540 there
had been a warrant issued by Henry VIII to Sir Anthony
Denny, Master of the Great Wardrobe, to deliver certain
quantities of silks and stuffs to “The nurse of Prince
Edward, to Catharine Champernoone, to Ann Basset, and
to Jane the Foole” (Add. MS. 7100, Brit. Mus.).</p>

<p>In the autumn after Mary’s accession she allowed for the
Coronation to William Somers “A gowne of blue satten,
the ground yellow stripping with a slight gold, a jerkin
furred, with sleeves of same, furred with conie” (427 (4)
Exchequer Accounts, Q.R., P.R.O.).</p>

<p>Mary’s warrants to Sir Edward Waldegrave, Keeper of
the Great Wardrobe, were generally in favour of an individual
or group of individuals of the same class, as of the
ladies of her chamber or ushers of her Court. So much
was to be “delivered” either for the occasion or annually.
I have not as yet found a notice of Jane so early as those of
the others, but this may arise from the fact that her expenses
were always included with those of the Queen, and
were apparently retrospective. Mary’s special warrants
included her own personal wants, with occasional references
to those of King Philip; those of one lady, probably the
“chief” of her “women,” at first Lady Margaret Clifford
(until her marriage to Lord Strange on 7th February
1555-6); afterwards “Lady Jane Seymour,” but always those
of her two fools, William and Jane, sometimes in strange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
juxtaposition. The earliest after her accession which has
been preserved is that of 27th April 1 Mary 427 (11)
Exchequer Accounts, in which are included:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Item, for thre yerdes of black satten geuen to Mʳ Herte, being
Jane our Foole’s Valantyne, <i>all of our great guardrobe</i>.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>Item, for making of a Douche gowne for Jane our Foole of

the bodyes lyned with fustian.</p>

<p>Item for making of a kirtle for her of striped silk lyned with
cotton, the bodyes and placket lyned with lynnen cloth.</p>

<p>Item for making of a Douche gowne for her of Crimson satten

<p>Item for making of a kirtle for her of blewe silke fringed over,

<p>Item for making of a Douche gowne for her of crimson striped

<p>Item for making of a peticoate for her all of red cloth.</p>

<p>Item for making of a Frenche gowne for the Ladye Margaret
Clifford of purple satten, etc.</p>
</div>

<p>It is a pity that the cost of the items is not given in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
series of papers, but it is evident that there is no distinction
of quality between the dress of Jane, and that of the great
ladies of the Court, though there is sometimes in the
colours or combinations, and generally in the shape. Jane
seems to have worn Dutch gowns, and the courtiers French
gowns, but the material is as good for Jane as for them and
the number of garments greater.</p>

<p>The gentleman alluded to as Jane’s Valentine was probably
one of the sons of Sir Percival Hart, who are recorded
as performing then a device of their own before
the Queen at Court.</p>

<p>This fact seems to suggest that Jane mingled with the
other courtiers on a somewhat equal footing. As to what
“a Valentine” really implied we cannot be sure, but it
seems to have been normally conducted by an annual casting
of lots. In Mary’s privy purse expenses there is an
illustrative entry: “Item geven to George Mountjoye drawing
my Lady Grace to his Valentyne.” And in the list of
the Princess’s jewels is another: “Item, a Broche of gold
enamyled blacke with an agaite of the story of Abraham
with foure small rockt rubies,” while at the margin is added
“Geven to Sir Antony Browne drawing her Grace to his
Valentyne.”</p>

<p>At the foot of each page is the signature “Marye,” showing
that the Princess had passed the entries. In the
autumn of the year 1 and 2 Philip and Mary 17th October,
the Queen being at Westminster, issued her warrants (427,
11. Exchequer Accounts):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Item to the said Marie Wilkinson our Silkewoman for one rich

</div>

<p>Then appears an item for “translating” some gowns for
Lady Margaret Clifford; then:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>Item, more to the saide Henry Arnolde our Shewmaker, for
seven peire of shews to the saide Jane our fole.</p>
</div>

<p>This paper gives us two or three suggestive points. It
shows that the knitted silk stockings, supposed to be a new
experience to Queen Elizabeth, were liberally given to the
Court Fool in the previous reign. It also introduces a new
word, “Beden,” evidently a proper name, which can only
mean one of two things; either that there was a second
Female Fool, and a third Court Fool, nowhere else alluded
to, or that “Beden” was the patronymic of Jane, which I
take to be the case. I looked carefully through all the
household lists of earlier years for a resembling name, and
find a “John Bedon” mentioned three times as yeoman of
the Chamber to Henry VIII in 1525, 1531, and 1533, who
would have been a suitable enough father for her. There
was also a John Beddon, master of the vessel sailing to
Bordeaux for the King’s wine in 1526, and a Richard
Bedon on the commission of the peace for Surrey, 1541. I
cannot connect “Jane” with any of these, but thought it
wise to note the names, as they may later yield some clue
to her paternity.</p>

<p>The accounts here fail us at the Record Office, but fortunately
they have strayed no further than to the Bodleian
Library, whither they may be followed. Only six months
later than the above list there were more garments ordered
for Jane, (See Calendar of Charters and Rolls in the
Bodleian, W. H. Turner; see also p. xviii.) In the account
for 1 and 2 Philip and Mary, 10th April, at Hampton
Court, we find:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

yerdes of Vellat to garde the same for lining, making, and embroidering

<p>Item, for 12 peire of shewes for the said Jane.</p>
</div>

<p>The account of six months later, also preserved at the
Bodleian, continues the story (1st October 2 and 3 Philip
and Mary, Greenwich):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Item for making of a loose gowne of greene vellat for Jane our

<p>Item, for making of two Grene coates for the saide William
Sommer, the one garded with Vellat, the other playne and lyned
with cotton.</p>
</div>

<p>Some other accounts seem to have vanished altogether.
Jane appears to have been in trouble again, as among the
lists of New Year’s gifts for 1556 are two:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Geven to a woman dwellyng at Burye for healing Jane the
Foole her eye, oone guilt salt with cover.</p>

<p>To Maistres Ager for keping the saide Jane during the time of
the healing of her eye, two guilt saltes.</p>
</div>

<p>The relative handsomeness of these gifts seems to show
Mary’s appreciation of her Woman Fool. A later account
at the Record Office (427, 18 Exchequer Accounts, 27th
March, 6 Mary, Greenwich) shows continued liberality:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Item thre yerdes of blacke Satten geven to Mʳ Barnes, being

</div>

<p>The next item is a long list of velvet shoes for the Lady
Jane Seymour—so long, indeed, that one must think she
had to supply the other ladies of the Chamber.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Item for twelve peire of shewes for the saide Jane Foole.</p>

<p>Item to the saide Mary Wilkenson, for four elles of Holland
delivered to the said William Somer, etc.</p>
</div>

<p>The special feature of handkerchiefs in the wardrobe of
William Sommers is noticeable. Other retainers do not
seem to have had similar grants. He had apparently had
this year a visit from his sister, whose relatively humble
position is implied by the material of her garment. It may
be remembered that Armin in his “Nest of Ninnies” gives
a delightful account of the visit of William Sommers’ uncle
to Court in Henry’s days. But we hear nothing further of
the sister.</p>

<p>It is difficult to decide which “Mʳ Barnes” was Jane’s
Valentine this year.</p>

<p>Then comes the last account of all, which becomes touching
when we remember how Mary, crushed with ill-health,
and the neglect of the husband for whom she had risked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
so much, with the loss of Calais, with long-continued “evil
weather,” with the disaffection of her subjects, and the
shrinking of her income, gave up all gaiety and expense.</p>

<p>Yet Mary, <i>about to die</i>, does not limit her expenditure
upon her Court Fools, faithful among many faithless.
(Exchequer Accounts, 31st October, 6 Mary 427, 18.)
St. James:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Item, for furring of a gown of red fustian of Naples for Jane
oure fole, with a here collored furre....</p>

<p>Item for William Somer our fole, seven ounce and a haulf of

</div>

<p>And then the end came. Doubtless Mary’s two fools,
after the way of their kind, knew more of the heart of their
liberal mistress than many of her retainers. They do not
seem to have offered their services to her successor, or to
have been invited to her Court, though William Sommers
had some payments made to him early in her reign. He
apparently gravitated eastward from the Court, to the
neighbourhood afterwards so famous for players and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
jesters, and he was buried in St. Leonard’s parish church
in the Liberty of Shoreditch on 15th June 1560.</p>

<p>But there is no further word of Jane—she disappeared
on the death of her royal mistress. I did not know of the
name of “Beden” when I went through the registers of
many London parishes; and though I have gone through
the printed registers of others, I have as yet seen no record
of the burial of any “Jane Beden,” or even of “Jane, a
woman,” as was sometimes a clerk’s way of expressing the
identity of the defunct. It is possible that through the
suggestion of the patronymic some future worker may find
some more details of the life of Jane, Queen Mary Tudor’s
female Fool.</p>

<p>It has been presumed that Elizabeth found her life
interesting enough, and her Court attractive enough,
to be able to do without the spice of the Court Fool or the
contrasts of the Court Dwarf. But though no facetiae have
come down to us as memorials of their existence in contemporary
letters or State Papers, it is evident that she
sometimes, at least, had such attendants. From the
accounts of the Treasurer of the Chamber, we can see that
Mary and Elizabeth supported William Somers, their
father’s Fool, until his death. (He was buried in St.
Leonard’s, Shoreditch, on 15th June 1560.)</p>

<p>Scrappy notes are scattered through the Warrants and
Wardrobe Accounts in the Lord Chamberlain’s Books, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
give us a few details. There is one series of these in
English, and another in Latin, richly garnished with English
borrowings. In later papers we find references to “the
Fool,” and other allusions to unclassified persons who may
have acted as such. There are “Sara Snow,”<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> “Monarcho,”
“William Shenton,” “a little Blackamoor,” and “Thomazina,
our Woman Dwarf.” There is also a mysterious
“Ipolyta the Tartarian,” who has a warrant dormant
granted her for sets of robes and garments every year,
dated 4 and 5 Elizabeth, in which she is described as
“Ipolyta the Tartarian, our dearly beloved woman.” Some
of the particular payments for her robes and kirtles and
the richness of her clothes show she was dressed on a level
with the Court ladies. About the same time are granted
clothes to another woman, and between the two is mentioned
unconnectedly “The Foole.” This is the first time
any fool is mentioned. Such rarely are referred to without
a name, if it is so done here. It is possible it may refer to
one of the women. It has been said that “there have been
no women fools.” But I answered that statement in my
paper in this journal on “Jane, the Queen’s Fool” (12th
August 1905). To understand the present reference I must
give it here in full:</p>

<table class="autotable">

</table>

<p>On page 41 is another of those entries which suggest
more than they tell, the first notice of “Monarcho”:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To Thomas Ludwell for making of a gowne of red grograyne
chamblet for an Italian named Monarcho garded with three
yardes of blue velvet with buttons of copper gold, a doublet for
him of striped sackcloth faced with red taffeta,</p>
</div>

<p class="p0">lined with fustian furred, and “a hat of blue taffeta striped
with gold lace.”</p>

<p>On page 240 there were a number of similar robes
entered “for Monarcho,” and after these,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Item, for making of a Gascon coate for a lytle Blackamore of
white Taffata, cut and lyned under with tincel, striped down with
gold and silver, and lined with buckram and bayes, poynted with
poynts and ribands ... and faced with taffata ... with a white
taffata doublet with gold and silver lace, silver buttons, faced with
Taffata; a payre of Gascons, a pair of knit hose, a paire of white
shoes and pantoufles, a dozen of poynts, and a paire of gaiters.</p>
</div>

<p>On page 266 appears:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Foole. Item, for making of a Gaskyn cote for a foole
of graie cloth, striped with sylke lace sewed with sylke, with
buttons and poyntynge riband faced with taffata, lined with
fustian; for making of a doublet for him of Striped Sackcloth
trymmed with silk lace, faced with taffeta lined with fustian....
Item, for making a hatt for the said foole of gray clothe, layd
upon with sundry devices of sylke lace and a feather trimmed
with gold and spangles. For a pair of gaskins for a foole of gray
clothe trimmed with lace of divers colours.</p>
</div>

<p>On page 310:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Monarcho ... a gowne of gold Tincell for Monarcho guarded
with yellow velvet layd on with lace, faced with chaungeable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
macadowe ... a doublet for him of striped sackcloth trymmed
with lace ... a jerkin [for him] of chaungeable mockado striped
above with billymente lace, furred with 44 black coney skynnes
and 10 white lamb skynnes.</p>
</div>

<p>On page 312:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Item, for making of a coate of freyze for William Shenton our
Foole, cut and lined underneath with mockado ... for making
of a doblet of striped sackcloth trymmed with lace ... a pair of
gascons of mockado trimmed all over with billyment lace, 2 paire
of knit stockings, garters, and girdle of leven taffata and 2 knit
cappes.</p>
</div>

<p>The resemblance between the dress of “William Shenton
our Foole” and that of “Monarcho” makes me think the
latter also of the class Fool.</p>

<p>Some have suggested that Richard Tarleton acted the
Fool to Elizabeth, but he was very different. He was the
chief of the Queen’s company of players, of whom Stow
says “for a wondrous pleasant extemporal wit, he was the
wonder of his time.”</p>

<p>After many years of accounts for “Ipolyta the Tartarian”
she disappears, and her place in the books is filled
by another (v. 36), even more gorgeously robed, in 1577-8
(page 110):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Dwarf. Item, for making of two gownes, thone of white
damask, thother of blew chamblet [for a woman dwarf] for two
peticoats, thone of mockado, thother of red kersey [for the said
Dwarf], laced with blew silk, upperbodied with mockado.</p>
</div>

<p>Page 174, 1578-9:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For making of a straight bodied gown of chamblet for
Thomasina, a woman dwarf, garded with velvet, laid on with lace

striped with copper gold, laid over with lace ... a straight bodied
gown of watched taffeta with hanging sleeves laid with lace of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
counterfeit silver and silk ... a paire of sleeves of orange collored
Taffata ... a peticoat of stamell coloured cloth garded with velvet
laid on with lace of crimson sylke with bodies of crimson taffata.</p>
</div>

<p>The materials become richer as the years go on. 1580:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A gowne of blacke wrought vellat, the grounde yellow sattin,
for Thomasina the dwarfe, layde with counterfeit silver lace ... a
straight bodyed gown of yellow satten striped with silver ... a
gowne of orrendge coloured chamblet garded with blacke vellat
... 3 paire of sleves of white satin (p. 239).</p>
</div>

<p>She was in mourning in 1585.</p>

<p>From the other series of accounts in Latin an even fuller
description can be gained of the increasing gorgeousness of
“Thomasina, our Woman dwarf”:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>a <i>toga</i> of white satin with gold lace and ribbon, the sleeves jagged
and lined with carnation satin.</p>
</div>

<p>In 1589 she had a</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p0">gown of carnation and black fygured satin lined with silver lace, a
stomacher and sleeves of white satten cut and lined with silver
lace; a gowne of changeable silk grograine with 2 paire of sleeves,
and a stomacher and sleeves of white sattin, fringed with gold
lace; a petycoat of changeable tuft-taffeta with 3 gold lace about,
the bodyes carnation satin.</p>
</div>

<p>The following year she had a similar gown of tuft taffeta
laced about with Venice silver, the bodice and sleeves
wrought all over with like lace. The next gown for
“Thomasina Muliercula” was a variety</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p0">in yelow vellat laced about with Venise silver, the sleeves cutt and
drawne out with cobweb lawn, a stomacher of white satin lined
with sarcenet laced with gold lace ... the bodyes of carnation
satten.</p>
</div>

<p>Another year she had a gown of carnation velvet with
silk lace, cut, and drawn out with cobweb lawn and tinsel,
sleeves of white satin laced with gold. The price of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
material is given in this series. In 1590 she had a blue
velvet dress, seven yards, at 24<i>s.</i> the yard; the next year a
carnation velvet of same price, richly adorned, sleeves of
white satin and gold lace; a loose gown of black damask,
with a pair of sleeves of tawny satin. In 1592 there is “a
gowne of tawny silk grograine at 16<i>s.</i> the yard, sleeves
of white satin”; next year a yellow velvet again. In 1594
we find</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p0">a haire coloured velvet gown and hanging sleeves wrought with
silver, white satin showes laced with gold lace, a gown of white
taffeta lined with satin tincel; a gowne of willow-coloured velvet
at 22<i>s.</i> a yard.</p>
</div>

<p>She was in flame-coloured silk in 1596, next year in
black velvet and black silk, and the following year in
purple tuft taffeta, as if she had been in mourning. In
1600, after all the honourable ladies of the Court, appears
“Thomasina our Woman Dwarf,” and the supply allowed
to her is noted. The following volume in this series seems
to have been lost.</p>

<p>But in another series she is entered still as “Thomazina
Muliercula,” 43-44 Elizabeth, on which occasion she had a
“robe of satin tawny with sleeves of cut satin lined with
gold,” etc. This series runs through five volumes, but I am
afraid of giving references, they have changed so often since
I began to go through the whole of the books twelve years
ago. They used to be L.C. II. 22, etc. I thought the names
which I have selected worth noting, as they may hereafter
explain some recondite allusions. I remember having seen
“Monarcho” mentioned in contemporary literature, but
forget the reference.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> I have found no further notices of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
William Shenton, nor any further information about
Thomasina. She disappears from the Lord Chamberlain’s
books with her royal mistress, and she is resuscitated
nowhere else. She evidently did nothing to distinguish
herself for good or bad. But she lived longer in her office
than any of the others, and she adds a feature to our
picture of Court life during the later years of Elizabeth.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXVIII">XXVIII<br><span class="small">THE ROLL OF COVENTRY<br>THE ARREST OF PRINCE HENRY</span></h2></div>



<p>There is a delightful roll in Birmingham Public
Library, not like those massive lesson-books called in
the Record Office, “Recusant Rolls,” “Coram Rege Rolls,”
etc., but a little roll, not six inches in breadth, and not very
long, though it records notes on the history of Coventry
during three hundred years.</p>

<p>It is entered in the Catalogue of Warwickshire MSS. as
“No. 115,915. Citizens of Coventry with right to wear swords,
1352-1650.” Though this can hardly be called incorrect, it
is, as a title, certainly incomplete and misleading; for the
little roll is <i>a list of the Bailiffs or Mayors of Coventry</i> during
that period. Very often it is only a bare list, and as
none of the names of the office-holders are very striking, I
did not transcribe them altogether, finding a lack of consecutive
interest in a string of mere names.</p>

<p>But against some of these names are remarks, records of
the most notable events of the year of each man’s mayoralty,
or what the writer took to be such. I am not about to
discuss the position or office of the writer, or even to attempt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
to fix the exact date at which the roll was written,
if it did not grow through the ages. It is at least old. But
the writer seems to have been a selector and a copyist, because
he is not certain in the reckoning of the regnal years,
and generally renders them as a year too late. I give here
the double date of the years of a mayoralty. I am only
about to record those remarks which can, in general, be
understood in the light of contemporary history, and occasionally
reflect some light upon its pages.</p>

<p>The Roll begins with a bare list of names from 1352.
The first which is annotated is:</p>

<p>The Roll ends without any concluding remark. Now the
Leet-Book of Coventry has been edited (or at least full
selections from it from 1384 to 1590) by Miss Dormer
Harris, and though it gives very much fuller information
concerning the history of Coventry, some items occur in
this Roll which do not occur in the Leet-Book. “Life in
an Old English Town: a History of Coventry,” also by
Miss Dormer Harris, gives very many more details, but
misses some of these.</p>

<p>There remains a special charm in this little roll compared
to the comparatively commonplace quartos which
give even fuller information. A copyist, about the end of
the seventeenth century, compiled a sort of history of the
Mayors of Coventry (Harleian MS. 6388, f. 15).</p>

<p>While many of these short notes have a special value of
their own, we may be allowed to express a particular interest
in the record of John Hornby, here given as 1412-13.</p>

<p>Many able articles have been written, and speeches made,
about the possibility or impossibility of a Lord Chief Justice
committing a prince to prison. Many researches have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
been undertaken, in the Record Office and elsewhere, to try
to discover any historical basis for the story regarding
Prince Hal and the Lord Chief Justice Gascoigne, which so
delighted Shakespeare that he added to it. But all researches
have been in vain. No fact that in any way supports
the tradition has been preserved. The story itself has
been traced no further back than to Sir Thomas Elyot, who
refers to it without giving the name of the Justice. Here, in
this little Coventry Roll, it is recorded, as <i>the</i> event of John
Hornby’s year, that “he arrested the Prince in the city of
Coventry.” We should like to have been told more, and to
have heard the cause and consequence of the arrest.</p>

<p>This is the only trustworthy story of any <i>arrest</i> of Prince
Henry, and it is possible that the action of Mayor John
Hornby, as Justice of the Peace in right of his office, became
the foundation for the legend concerning the anonymous
Lord Chief Justice. We know from other sources
that Prince Henry was a good deal in Coventry when acquiring
military experience in the Welsh wars, that he lay
at Cheylesmore House in the immediate vicinity, and he
probably took his amusements in Coventry. It may only
be Shakespeare’s imagination which fixed the scene of his
convivial gatherings with Falstaff and his train at the
Boar’s Head Tavern in East Cheap. It is possible—indeed,
more than likely—that these were carried on at Coventry,
and that some breach of the peace there forced the courageous
Mayor to do justice even against his popular prince.</p>

<p>We know that Shakespeare, to glorify Henry V, makes
him retain the Lord Chief Justice Gascoigne in office on his
accession, as a proof of his recognition of courage and
directness in the administration of justice. This, as Dr.
Blake Odgers pointed out, in an address to the Shakespeare
League, was proof positive that Bacon did not write the
play of “Henry IV, Part II,” at least. He <i>knew better</i>. For
Gascoigne had been a Gray’s Inn man, and so was Bacon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
and the latter knew that the young king Henry V did <i>not</i>
appoint Gascoigne to be his Lord Chief Justice. The records
of Gray’s Inn prove that, and also the epitaph on Gascoigne’s
tombstone, where it was clearly stated that he
“had been Lord Chief Justice to King Henry the IV.”
That epitaph would not have been silent about King
Henry V if he had reappointed his father’s choice in the
office of Lord Chief Justice.</p>

<p>It seems ungracious to dispute the credit of Shakespeare
as an historian; but truth is better than fiction. The testimony
that Prince Hal <i>was</i> arrested at Coventry may
stimulate our imaginations anew, and lead us to further research
in fresh directions.</p>

<p>One other point may be noted. It is generally supposed
that the local records say nothing about the intended duel
between Bolingbroke and Mowbray. But this authority
gives the suggestive idea that the combatants were received
by the crafts in liveries, and had a banquet “on horseback”!
King Richard II himself is not referred to.</p>

<p>Each of the short notes might be dwelt on and expanded
indefinitely. As they stand, they only show us what struck
the scribe as the note of the year.</p>

<p>PS. A captious correspondent writing the following week
was very scornful about my calling this a “delightful little
roll” when there were other manuscripts, (which I had mentioned),
about my publishing extracts from it, indeed, as it
had already been printed. Some form of it had appeared
in Dr. Thomas’s edition of Dugdale, p. 147. But the printing
referred to had been sandwiched irrelevantly into an appendix
to a little-known book, “Fordun’s Scotochronicon,”
by Hearne, and he certainly had <i>not</i> taken this little roll
as his copy. His recension is indeed different in some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
details from Harl. MS. 6388, and also from Add. MS.
11364. Neither of these seem to have been known to my
critic, who thought he made a point, that a third MS.,
called the City Annals, containing similar entries, is to be
found among the muniments of Coventry from 1350 to
1566, the continuation from that year having been torn
away and replaced in a later hand. This, however, Miss
Dormer Harris had mentioned in a note in her “Life in an
Old English Town.” But the objections were made only
to lead up to the discussion of the arrest of the prince.
He did not consider the story at Coventry trustworthy, and
blamed me for suggesting even that it might have given
the idea to Shakespeare. He considered Shakespeare’s
story incorrect, and only invented by Sir Thomas Elyot.
Such a fact must have attracted attention, and must have
been mentioned in some of the records of the time. But
a most exhaustive search had been made, without avail,
therefore it must be supposed to have been taken from
the story of Edward II, who when a prince was expelled
from Court for half a year for insulting one of his father’s
ministers, though he was not imprisoned for the offence, as
the Rev. A. J. Church noted in his “Henry V.”</p>

<p>The critic was desirous of supporting the character of
Prince Hal, and added that the day after he succeeded his
father he caused to be summoned to his first Parliament
“Sir William Gascoigne Knight, Chief Justice of our Lord
the King, assigned to hold pleas before our Lord the King,
before the King himself.” He had also a grant of four
bucks and does annually for life, which shows that the
King did reappoint him, and his intention was to keep him
in office. It must have been, therefore, at his own request
that his patent was not renewed. To this I replied, pointing
out that Henry V summoned his first Parliament on
23rd March, and appointed a new Lord Chief Justice on
the 29th, <i>the only one of the Judges replaced</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span></p>

<p>Miss Dormer Harris joined in the discussion as to the
truth of the record, and added that there were two Ardens,
John and Geoffrey, mentioned in the Leet Book in 1461;
that it noted in 1545 “Shakespere’s house in the new rent
vacant the yeir 2/6” that a “Richard Shackspeare of
Hinkly and Jane Erdsone of the cittie of Coventry widow
were marryed before Mr. Matthew Smith Justis of peace
the 20th of August 1656” (Holy Trinity Register).</p>

<p>Lastly, the citizens in Hornby’s year, Candlemas 1412 to
Candlemas 1413, lent £100 to the Prince (Leet Book 61).</p>

<p>Sir James H. Ramsay wrote to say historical students
were much indebted to me for having published the extracts,
especially the one about the Prince, which shows
that a Prince <i>could</i> be arrested. The original disputant
wrote again against my “little roll,” as compared to the
“other rolls” (which are paper quartos), and then turned
his attention to demolishing Sir James Ramsay’s remarks,</p>

<p>The small quarto, Harl. 6388, was bought in 1690 by
Mr. Humfrey Wanley, with accounts of Coventry and its
Mayors from 1348 till the Revolution. The Collector’s
name seems to have been Miles Flint, who gives the following
account of his authorities: “This book was taken
out of Manuscripts. The one written by Mr. Christopher
Owen Mayor of this Citty, which contains the charter of
Walter de Coventre, concerning ye Comons &amp;c. to Godfrey
Leg, Mayor 1637. The other beginning at the 36 Mayor of
this citty and continued by several hands, and lately by Edmund
Palmer, late of this Citty Counsellor, till Mr. Yardly
late Mayor 1689 1690; and another written by Mr. Bedford,
and collected out of divers others and continued to
Mr. Septimus Bott: and two others collected by Tho.
Potter, and continued to Mr. Robert Beake, and another
written by Mr. Francis Basnett, to the first year of Mr.
Jelliff’s mayoralty and another written by Mr. Abraham
Ashley and continued to Mr. Sep’ Bott; and another written<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
by Mr. Abraham Boune and Humphrey Wightwick, 1607.”
On the title-page is recorded:</p>

<p>“Humphrey Wanley (that is Oneley) bought this of Mr.
Tipper, December 17th 1690, price 6<i>d.</i>” The book notes
that—</p>

<p>“Richard Stoke 1356, brought in the good strikes.” John
Smith is called “Smither,” and the Parliament is called a
“layman’s parliament.” When it reaches the special date, it
reads, “William Hornebye 1411-12. He arrested the Prince
in the Priory of Coventry. A quarter of wheat sold for
twenty shillings,”</p>

<p>“William Dilcocke, 1412-13. In his year died King
Henry.”</p>

<p>The later entries are not dated, and John Yardeley was
the last mayor mentioned.</p>

<p>Add. MS. 11364, “presented by Mr. Joseph Gibbs,” contains:</p>

<p>“A brief History of Ye city of Coventry from Ye most
early accounts of it,” which tells about Leofric and Godiva.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>It begins in 1348 the story of the mayors with John
War. It gives:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1412. John Horneby. He arrested ye Prince in ye Priory of
Coventry.</p>

<p>1512. Richard Horsfell Draper seven burned in little parke and

&amp;c. in English.</p>

<p>1597. John Whitehead and John Breers. (Here is much writing
of scarcity and its causes—great differences from roll.)</p>

<p>1703. Jonah Crynds (the last mayor mentioned).</p>
</div>

<p>Miss Dormer Harris, in the year after my paper, brought
out her “Story of Coventry and the Kingdom,” in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
she discusses the arrest, from the point of view of the fact
that the later recorded arrest of the Earl of Warwick can
be proved to be an error, and an explicable one.</p>

<p>Mr. Fowler gave me an interesting note which may come
in here, as it may have some bearing on the reality of
Shakespeare’s Boar’s Head Inn. It is from Chancery Inquisitions,
Post Mort., Vol. 151, No. 72. London, 1568-9.</p>

<p>Robert Harding held land in the city, including:
“... one messuage, tenement, or tavern, called ‘Le Boares
Heade,’ situated and lying in Eastcheap in the parish of
St. Michael in Crooked Lane ... formerly in the tenure
and occupation of John Broke and now of Edward Beltam.

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXIX">XXIX<br><span class="small">THE STRATFORD POET</span></h2></div>


<p>The Editor<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> has courteously allowed me to reply to
his article, “The Great Stratford Superstition,” as I
have studied all the works of Bacon and Shakespeare,
most of the writings concerning the Baconian Heresy, and
have answered the chief of them. The first recorded student
of Shakespeare was a woman, Mrs. Ann Merrick, who, on
21st January 1638, wrote from the country to a friend in
London, that she could not come to town that year, but
must content herself “with the <i>study</i> of Shakespeare and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
the History of Women” (State Papers, Dom. Ser., Charles I,
409 (167).) In these two interests, thus early and specially
combined, I follow the lady’s lead.</p>

<p>One short magazine article cannot possibly deal with
the subject exhaustively, therefore I only attempt to make
a general protest against the Editor’s paper, and to illustrate
a few of its weaknesses.</p>

<p>“Possession is nine-tenths of the law”; from which proverb
it would seem that the arguments for Bacon’s authorship
would require to be ten times as strong as Shakespeare’s,
before they can have a reasonable chance of
ousting the present possessor from his dramatic name and
fame. On the contrary, there is no real <i>argument</i> for putting
Bacon out of the great sphere which he designed for himself,
into one designed by his admirers, but utterly incongruous
to his nature and powers. All his own contemporaries,
all his immediate successors, and all their
descendants for 250 years, attributed the plays to their
author, Shakespeare. Guess-work began about the middle
of the nineteenth century, and like a snowball rolling,
gradually increased by external accretion, but not by vital
energy. I do not deny that there are some apparent difficulties
and some strange coincidences, or Baconianism, as
a cult, could not have been possible. But these difficulties
depend upon our temporary ignorance, these coincidences
may be explained in a different way from that on which
the Baconians insist.</p>

<p>Francis Bacon was a genius, and a well-trained one. He
early saw the deficiencies of the science and philosophy of
his day. His devotees to-day do not follow his prime
advice for conducting investigations enunciated in his great
“Novum Organum,” “to search after negatives” to any
hypothesis they may start. On the contrary, they greedily
accept everything, however unfounded, that tells in the
favour of their new theory, and ignore whatever contradicts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
their points. No amount of repetition will make a hazy
and unfounded tradition into a fact, and inferences from
unsound premises give no worthy conclusion. I can only
bring forward a few of my facts here, and still fewer of my
inferences.</p>

<p>Echoing the cry of old, “Can any good come out of
Nazareth?” the Baconians commence by crying, “Can any
good come out of Stratford and Warwickshire?” and to
give weight to the cry, strive to belittle the place.</p>

<p>It may be remembered that a fine German writer, Jean
Paul Richter, insisted that a “poet should always have
himself born in a small city.” There are many reasons that
made the “small city” of Stratford eminently suitable for
the birthplace of a poet. It was at the very heart of England,
the centre of the converging influences of descent and
of legend from British and Saxon and Danish ancestors.
The great Roman roads crossed not far off, and Stratford,
with her substantial bridge, was on the line of traffic.
Stratford was a thriving town, “emporiolum non inelegans,”
says Camden. Its gentle, undulating scenery lay just on
the borders of a great forest,</p>

<p>It had had an aristocratic semi-religious guild from
ancient times, centre of the county families, an old college,
now also passed away, and a noble church, still existing.
Becon, a great scholar, in 1549 speaks of Warwickshire as
the most intellectual of all the English counties, and Stratford,
in Shakespeare’s time at least, had a town-council
intelligent enough to know the value of a good schoolmaster,
and to seek to secure him in the practical way by
offering double the amount of salary enjoyed by the head-master
of Eton and others. The books used in the grammar
schools of the day can be found in the writings of Mulcaster<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
and Brinsley, and by reference to the Stationers’
Registers. The status of the schoolmaster determined the
character of the study and of the books. Those who say
that Stratford was then a “bookless neighbourhood” speak
without book. It is easy for a particular instance to destroy
so universal an affirmative. There was, at least, one suit at
law because a man had not returned a book he had borrowed;
and from my own knowledge of their names, I can
state that one curate alone had 170 books of the best
selections in philosophy, divinity, history, literature, and
legend. I know that Mr. Shakespeare bought at least one.</p>

<p>After decrying Stratford, the Baconians attempt to defame
young Stratford Shakespeare. Fortunately, when he
was young, his father was one of the most important men
in the place, and as the grammar-school was free to all the
sons of burgesses, it is more than reasonable to suppose
that he had his full opportunities given him. Of course, he
may have neglected them, which is an occasional way with
a genius. There is <i>no</i> authority for the statement that
Shakespeare was apprenticed to a butcher. Even if he
had been so, that circumstance would not have quenched a
native genius that rebelled against it. Wolsey was the son
of a butcher, so was Akenside. Keats was the son of a
livery stable keeper. There <i>is</i> authority for his early marriage,
imprudent because his father was in pecuniary difficulties
at the time, but just the kind of marriage one would
have expected from his poetic, impulsive tendencies. His
relations to life, property, and literature were more like
those of Sir Walter Scott than any other man. When he
found himself in difficulties, he bravely set himself to the
task of attempting to retrieve the fallen fortunes of the
family, and set off to London. The Baconians firmly
believe that he had to fly to escape the consequences of his
poaching affair, but has it never struck them how humorous
it is to think that Bacon showed spite at Sir Thomas Lucy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
for the whipping that Shakespeare received? Bacon in
reality was a very good friend of the Lucy family. I exposed
the whole falsity of this tradition two years ago in
the “Fortnightly Review,” in an article entitled “Justice
Shallow <i>not</i> a Satire on Sir Thomas Lucy.”</p>

<p>When young Shakespeare went to London, there is proof
that he renewed his acquaintanceship with his Stratford
friend, Richard Field, the apprentice, son-in-law, and successor
of Vautrollier, the great printer, who had two
printing presses, and was allowed to keep six foreign
journeymen. For some years, at least, it is evident that
he took time to read Field’s books. Webster, his contemporary
dramatist, calls him “<i>industrious</i> Shakespeare.” I
say it is evident, because with the exception of a few books
referred to, such as Wilson’s “Art of Rhetoric,” “The
Paradise of Dainty Devices,” “Seneca,” “Plautus,” “Holinshed’s
History of England and Scotland,” and others, this
one firm alone printed all the books that were <i>necessary</i> for
the poet’s culture, and all classics that he refers to directly.</p>

<p>The limitation in authorities is a strong argument against
Bacon’s authorship, as well as the plentiful crop of unscholarly
blunders to be found in the plays.</p>

<p>Besides Field’s library, another opportunity of education
and culture was found for the poet in the romantic and
faithful friendship of the young Earl of Southampton, a
law-student and patron of literature. How can Baconians
gravely assert that Bacon <i>could</i> have written these two
dedications of 1593 and 1594 to Shakespeare’s poems?
How could he speak of the one poem as the “first heir of
his invention,” when he already had written much and
designed more? How could he say to Southampton in
print, “What I have done is yours, what I have to do is
yours,” while he was at that time a sworn follower of the
Earl of Essex? Shakespeare had no position in society or
literature sufficient to induce Bacon to use his name as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
mantle, by the time that Shakespeare’s two poems were
brought out by Shakespeare’s friend, Dick Field. The
sonnets resemble the poems too much in phrases, feelings,
and situations to doubt that the author is the same, and all
the three are claimed by Shakespeare in print.</p>

<p>Now, can the Baconians explain how they can believe
that Bacon, who at the age of thirty-one had already
planned “The Greatest Birth of Time,” and, filled with the
sublime self-conceit of conscious power, had written to
Lord Burghley in that year that he “had taken all knowledge
to be his province,” should have addressed the half-trained
young lad, Southampton (among many other
similar phrases), in the modest lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And heavy ignorance aloft to fly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have added feathers to the learned’s wing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And given grace a double majesty.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet be most proud of that which I compile,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose influence is thine and born of thee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In other’s works thou dost but mend the style,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And arts with thy sweet graces graced be—</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">But thou art all my art, and dost advance</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">As high as learning my rude ignorance.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Bacon simply could not have written these lines, at
least.</p>

<p>And it must be remembered that whoever was able to
write the sonnets and the poems, might become able in
time to write the fuller and richer plays.</p>

<p>There remain witnesses abundant that Shakespeare’s
London career was a personal success. Greene’s envy, no
less than Chettle’s praise, point to it, W. Covell, Thomas
Edwards, the authors of the Parnassus Plays, John Weever,
John Davies, and Thomas Thorpe; that he was a good
actor, John Marston, the dramatist, affirms, by asking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
whether he or Burbage acted best; John Davies also
couples their names together as players having</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Wit, courage, good shape, good parts and all good.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">and says of Shakespeare that he was a fit “companion for
a king.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou hast no rayling but a raygning witt,</div>

</div>

<p>The praises of his “works” are emphasized by Professor
Meres and many others; and the testimony of the love and
appreciation of “his fellows” is unstinted. It must never
be forgotten that perhaps the most undoubted praise was
that which an admirer fixed upon his tombstone, a shelter
to which surely Bacon cannot enter.</p>

<p>I must also protest against the assumption that Shakespeare
“returned to Stratford to lead an illiterate life.”
He returned there to live in the best house in the town,
bearing arms (then a much greater distinction than now),
as <i>all</i> his friends and relatives did, to associate on intimate
terms with the Combes, Collins, Walkers, Shaws, Nashes,
and probably all the county families, as tradition says,
especially that of William Somerville, of Edreston. He
returned there, and continued to write his plays in the
bosom of his family, with one son-in-law, the most distinguished
physician of his time, the possessor of a good
library, and his other prospective son-in-law, cultured up
to the level, at least, of affixing a suggestive French proverb
to his accounts, the year that he was Chamberlain.</p>

<p><i>It is not a fact</i> that he did not teach his favourite daughter
to read and write. It is probably because she responded
more rapidly to culture than her sister did that she became
his favourite, as his will proves. She is recorded to have
been “witty above her sex,” and like her father. Her
signature can still be seen in Stratford.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span></p>

<p>I now come to a stock statement of the Baconians that
might seem to a careless student founded on fact, that he
spent his time as a maltster and moneylender. They never
have taken the trouble to find out (as I have) the number
of contemporary Warwickshire Shakespeares. There was
a second John in Stratford-on-Avon, and a third in a
neighbouring village. There were several of the name of
William in the immediate neighbourhood, There was even
one at Hatton, who had a daughter <i>Susanna</i> in 1596;
there was another who was a malt-dealer and a money-lender.
His transactions commence during the poet’s life,
but, alas for the Baconian argument, they <i>continue for ten
years after the poet’s death</i>. The receipts can still be seen
at Warwick Castle. Of course, “selling malt” or not, is
quite irrelevant to the question in hand. There is only one
point, however, that may be noted in connection with it.
In all the plays there is no allusion to the processes of
malt-making, beyond the one proverb, or to the technique
of brewing or wine-making, as there is, for instance, of
printing. Shakespeare only treats the finished article, as
sold in the taverns, or drunk in the halls. He only notes
philosophically the effect that stimulants have on the
hearts, brains, and characters of men. This question never
troubles Bacon, but he knows all about the manufacture,
the keeping, storing, curing of ale, wine, mead, and
metheglin.</p>

<p>A similar powerful contrast may be seen regarding the
differing treatments of the horse and the chase. The poems
and plays are full of reference to the delights of the chase
and the sympathy subsisting between a rider and his noble
steed. The whole works of Bacon supply only three prosy
references to the existence of “the horse.”</p>

<p>The great stronghold of the Baconians is “The Promus.”
But the notes there are not <i>proved</i> to be original. Some of
them can be shown to be borrowed echoes of what the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
writer heard and read. Bacon was a great borrower, as
Shakespeare also undoubtedly was. Only a poet is not
expected to acknowledge “sources” in his dramas; which
a prose writer, in leisurely detail, is expected to do (Robert
Burton in his “Anatomy of Melancholy” did so). Only
last month I came across one of Chamberlain’s letters,
which records a witty saying of the Duchess of Richmond.
The writer adds, it might have got into Bacon’s Apophthegms,
which he had just published, “not much to his
credit.” Whole passages and facts are borrowed by Bacon
without acknowledgement from the ancients, trusting to
the general ignorance of his readers. The very cipher he
claimed as his own was published by Jean Baptist Porta
in 1568, and by Blaise de Vigenère in 1587.</p>

<p>I do not attempt to deal with the absurd notion that
any real poet could weight the wings of his muse with a
cipher. Dr. Nicholson of Leamington gave the <i>reductio ad
absurdum</i> to Mr. Donnelly’s, and other writers have let in
light upon later attempts at cipher mysteries.</p>

<p>The author of “The great Stratford Superstition” says
there are no improbabilities in supposing Bacon to have
written the plays. What? Bacon write “Romeo and Juliet”?
He did not know what love was! In his Essay on Love he
calmly asserts that the stage had been more beholden to
love than the life of man. In his life without love, the
“marriages” he sought, and the one he secured, were all
mercantile transactions. He did not deserve to be happy
in matrimony. Bacon write the humours of the fat knight?
Bacon was full of wisdom and abounded in wit, but of
humour he was absolutely destitute.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, once only have we a story of Bacon crossing
Shakespeare’s path, a crucial illustration of the impossibility
of his having written one play at least. “The
Comedy of Errors” was based on the Menoechmi of
Plautus, a translation of which was registered in the books<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
of the Stationers’ Company on 10th June 1594. Books at
that time were nearly always handed about in MS. before
printing, seeking patrons. Very probably this one was
shown to the Earl of Southampton, or Shakespeare may
have seen it in MS. It was more than six months after the
registration of the Menoechmi that the “Comedy of Errors”
appeared in peculiar circumstances, which I have treated
fully elsewhere. It was acted as a new play by Shakespeare’s
company, amid the uproars in Gray’s Inn Hall,
28th December 1594, when the Prince of Purpoole’s plans
came to grief. The Benchers felt it an intolerable disgrace,
and appointed Bacon to write a proper play to retrieve the
lost honour of Gray’s Inn. He wrote them the “Masque of
the Councillors,” which pleased his fellows, and the company
that they had re-invited to make amends for the
“Night of Errors.” This masque may yet be read, and is
exactly the measure of the dramatic capability of Francis
Bacon. It is quite a mistake to imagine that a good play
would have discredited him. On the contrary, the having
written the first English blank verse tragedy was, even at
the time, considered the highest distinction of a more
aristocratic man than Bacon, a diplomatist too, Thomas
Sackville, Lord Buckhurst.</p>

<p>Bacon’s allusion to himself as “a concealed poet” can be
clearly understood by those who study his works. He
would have called the “Utopia” of Sir Thomas More a
concealed poem, as he did call his own “New Atlantis,”
(See “De Augmentis Scientiarum,” Book II, Poesy, chap.
13.)</p>

<p>On the other hand, he distinctly states, “I profess not to
be a poet, but I <i>prepared</i> a sonnet directly tending to draw
on her Majesty’s reconcilement to my Lord of Essex,
<i>which I showed to a great person, who commended it</i>!”
Spedding, Bacon’s most able editor and biographer, says
of the poor versions of certain psalms put into English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
metre, “These were the <i>only</i> verses certainly of Bacon’s
making that have come down to us, and probably, with
one or two slight exceptions, the only verses he ever wrote.”</p>

<p>With Bacon and with Spedding I agree, and with Shakespeare.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXX">XXX<br><span class="small">SIXTEENTH CENTURY WOMEN STUDENTS</span></h2></div>


<p>Though we are all familiar with the lives of certain
notable ladies who reached a high standard of learning
during the sixteenth century, little or nothing is known
concerning the general education of girls and women of
that period. No Royal Reports enlighten us concerning
their opportunities, and no private study has elicited and
combined a definite series of details. It is therefore important
to note and collate all that may be gleaned concerning
this interesting subject.</p>

<p>There is reason to believe that in earlier times the schools
that <i>were</i> founded, were intended for “liberi”—not “pueri”
alone—and that what education there was for the people
was open to children of both sexes, as the trades were. I
may illustrate what I mean by the statute enacted 7 Henry
IV, c. 17.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“That no man or woman, of whatsoever estate or condition
they be, shall put their son or their daughter to serve as an apprentice,
except he or she have land or rent to the value of 20
shillings by the year, and no man or woman shall receive an apprentice
contrary to this ordinance, provided ... always that every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
man or woman of what estate or condition that he be, shall be free
to set their son or daughter to take learning at any manner school
that pleaseth them within the Realm.” (Statutes of the Realm.)</p>
</div>

<p>But by a limitation of meaning, the word “children” lost
its ambiguity of sex, and privileges became limited to boys
which our ancestors intended for girls and boys. This
took place all the more rapidly in the sixteenth century.
Reforms and reformations have always a tendency to be
to the disadvantage of women.</p>

<p>The intellectual developments of England during the
sixteenth century were moulded by three main streams of
influence—that of the Italian Renaissance, which partially
passed to us through France; that of the German and
Swiss Reformation; and that of the rapid improvements
in the art of printing. Social and political changes stimulated
the national intellect to high fervours, and the literary
spirit predominated. How much women shared in the
general advance of culture is too frequently only a matter
of inference, just as we may learn that a sheep, which we
have not seen, has passed through a hedge by a fleece of
wool caught on the branches. That many women had
learned to read we may infer from the religious history of
the time. We hear of women as amid those who flocked
to buy the testaments of Tyndale and the great Bibles of
Rogers; of women who suffered as heretics during the first
half, and as recusants during the second half, of the century,
doomed by the discovery of their <i>books</i>. And we know, on
the other side, that Dr. John Hall, of Maidstone, in his
“Court of Virtue,” reproached the gayer maidens of the
country with reading wicked songs and romances, when
they should have been reading the Scriptures. When the
decisions of the foreign universities against King Henry’s
marriage “were publyshed, all wyse men in the realme
moche abhorred that marriage; but women and such as
wer more wylful than wyse or learneyd spake against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
Determinacion and sayde that the Universities were corrupt,
and enticed so to doo,”<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> an opinion that many wise
men have held since. How <i>were</i> they educated? Probably
all mothers who knew taught their daughters, if only for
the sake of acquiring medical and cookery receipts. Doubtless,
all who were rich enough had tutors, and there is every
reason to believe that any number of unrecorded Dame
Schools flourished throughout the length and breadth of
the land, where children of both sexes were taught the
elements of reading from the Hornbook. (One lady who
was admitted to the Guild of Boston in the early part of
the century was described as a <i>schoolmistress</i>.) I have been
fortunate enough to find corroboration of my opinion in
the pages of a notable book on the education of boys, by
Richard Mulcaster, First Master of the Merchant Taylors’
School, 1581. He says: “Seeing that I begin so low as the
first elementary, wherein we see that young maidens be
also <i>ordinarily trained</i>,” etc. That seems to imply primary
education for many, if not for the mass of the people.</p>

<p>A still thicker veil hides us from the true state of their
secondary education. The destruction of the convents involved
the destruction of many opportunities of feminine
culture. Fuller says of them: “They were the schools where
the girls and maids of the neighbourhood were taught to
read and work, and sometimes a little Latin was taught
them, music, and Church History.”</p>

<p>Among the numerous schools founded or refounded in
the century, the Collegiate schools seem always to have
been reserved for boys, but we have no means of knowing
whether the schools founded by private laymen for <i>children</i>
were not originally intended for both sexes in England, as
they always were in Scotland, at the Reformation. We
know that Christ Church Hospital was so, and it is quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
probable that many others have since drifted into the one-sided
channel of masculine privilege. Stow includes in his
list of “charitable men” the names of many women. The
number of grants to schools and colleges is remarkable,
and suggests sympathy with education, that might have
extended to that of girls. He concludes: “Thus much for
the worthiness of citizens, both men and women, in this
citie.” I have not yet met an instance of a private foundation
of a school expressly for girls, or even of one in which
they were <i>stated</i> to have been included, until the next
century. Then Lucy, daughter of Sir Henry Goodyere,
niece of Drayton’s Warwickshire “Idea,” prevailed on her
husband, Sir Francis Nethersole of Kent, to found a school
in her native town of Polesworth, with “a liberal maintenance
of a schoolmaster and schoolmistress, to teach the
<i>children</i> of the parish, the boys to read and write English,
the girls to read and to work with the needle.” Whether
the founders were following an old custom, or whether they
found that unprotected foundations were apt to lapse, their
intention was preserved by cutting in stone over the doorways,
associated with their coats of arms, the words “puerorum,
puellarum” (Dugdale’s “Warwickshire” under “Polesworth”).</p>

<p>Whatever may be proved of foundations, I have always
been convinced of the existence of voluntary secondary
schools (<i>see</i> “L.L.L.,” iv, 2), and here again Richard
Mulcaster supports my opinion. As master of a boys’
school, and professing only to write for them, he might
well have passed over girls, but he did not. He devotes a
whole chapter to the subject of their education. Seeing
that some still doubted the wisdom of teaching them
<i>further than the elementary</i>, he gives, as four good reasons
for doing so:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>First. Because it is the <i>custom of my country</i>.</p>

<p>Second. Because it is a duty which we owe to them, wherein<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
we are charged in conscience not to leave them lame in that
which is for them.</p>

<p>Third. Because of their own towardness, which God would
never have given them had He meant them to remain idle.</p>

<p>Fourth. Because of the excellent effects in that sex when they
have had the help of good bringing up.</p>

<p>Their natural towardness ought to be cultivated because we
have it by commandment of the Lord, to train up, not only our
own sex, but our females, and He makes an account of natural
talents.</p>
</div>

<p>In expanding these heads, he adds suggestions that in
modern terminology at least would imply that there were
special opportunities for girls; for he says: “The custom
of my countrie hath made the maiden’s training her approved
travail,” though elsewhere he states that “there is
no <i>public</i> provision, but such as the professors of their
training do make of themselves.” He would not have
them go to the public grammar schools or the universities,
but advises all parents to educate them according to their
powers. He regrets that girls <i>in general</i> only study until
about the age of thirteen or fourteen, “wherein the matter
which they must deal withal, cannot be very much in so
little time, for the perfitting thereof requireth much travail!”
“Some <i>Timon</i> will say, What should women do
with learning? Such a churlish carper will never pick out
the best!” “Is it nothing to us to have our children’s
mothers well furnished in mind, and well strengthened in
body?” Mulcaster would give them the pencil to draw,
the pen to write; teach them some logic, rhetoric, philosophy
to furnish their general discourses, and the knowledge
of some tongues, as well as housewifery. He says
that the selection of studies depended upon whether a girl
was intended to marry or to earn her bread. As the trades-guilds
were then open to them, education would be of value
to those prepared to enter any of these, or to become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
teachers, or practitioners in some branches of medicine,
such as barber-surgeons, midwives, etc. Mulcaster, besides
giving theories, states facts:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We see young maidens taught to read and write, and can do
both with praise. We heare them sing and playe, and both passing
well; we knowe that they learne the best and finest of our
learned languages to the admiration of all men.... Whoso shall
denie that they may not compare even with our kind in the best
degree.... Do we not see some of that sex in our countrie so
excellently well trained as to be compared to the best Romaines
or Greekish paragonnes—</p>
</div>

<p class="p0">to the German, the French, or the Italians?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If no storie did tell it, if no state did allow it, if no example did
confirme it, that young maidens deserve trayning, this our own
myrrour, the majestie of her sex, doth prove it in her own person,
and commendes it to our reason. We have besides her Highness
as undershining starres, many singuler ladies and gentlewymen so
skilful in all cunning of the most laudable and loveworthy qualities
of learning, as they may well be alledged as presidents to prayse.</p>
</div>

<p>As they are “educated according to the wealth of their
parents, the greater born have better means of prosecuting
it best.”</p>

<p>I quote so much, as this is the sole special authority I
have for their <i>secondary education</i>. We know of their
higher culture from Spenser, Harrison, and others. It is
evident that private tutors were the teachers of at least
the higher education to women, and after the suppression
of the monasteries the number of these “poor scholars”
would be greatly increased for a time. But the profession
of governess had already been established.</p>

<p>In Dr. Dee’s Diary he notes, 1st September 1587:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I covenanted with John Basset to teach the children the Latin
tongue, and I to give him seven duckats by the quarter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span></p>

<p>September 1st, 1596, Mary Goodwyn cam to my service to
governe and teach Madinia and Margaret my young daughters.</p>
</div>

<p>I have not been able to learn anything of voluntary
schools in general, but there is reference to one in the
description of the education of one girl of the wealthy
upper middle classes of London, daughter of one great
merchant, and wife of another. Though her fame shows
that her successes were not quite commonplace, it also
suggests that she had numerous competitors and rivals.
Elizabeth Withypoll<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> is included by Ballard among his
“learned ladies”; and Stow notes her distinction, as may
be seen on her tombstone in the south aisle of the parish
church of St. Michael in Crooked Lane. Many such may
have passed into oblivion; this has been handed on to us.</p>

made at the cost of the said Emanuel, Merchant Taylor.</p>
</div>

<p>It is interesting to know that there <i>was</i> at least <i>one</i>
school for upper class girls in England, where English was
taught, and where Elizabeth won the prize, interesting also
that she used her English to read the Scriptures at that
date. There is almost a hint that her husband taught her
accounts, and it is possible she helped him with his business
affairs. Doubtless Elizabeth, however, learned her
accomplishments from tutors and masters, and there she
becomes a link with the upper ten thousand, educated in
the same way to a high standard in learning and accomplishments,
such as we see suggested in “The Taming of the
Shrew.”</p>

<p>Petrucio Ubaldini, a Florentine who came to England

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The rich cause their sons and daughters to learn Latin, Greek,
and Hebrew, for since this storm of heresy has invaded the land
they hold it useful to read the Scriptures in the original tongue.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span></p>

<p>Erasmus, in his Epistles, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>31. The scene of human things is changed: the monks, famed
in past times for learning, are become ignorant, and women love
books. It is beautiful that this sex should now betake itself to
ancient examples.</p>
</div>

<p>Udall, the Master of Eton, speaks with admiration of
their advance in learning:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The great number of noble women not only given to the study
of human sciences and strange tongues, but also so thoroughly
expert in Holy Scriptures that they were able to compare with
the best writers, as well in enditing and penning of godly and
fruitful treatises to the instruction and edifying of readers in the
knowledge of God, as also in translating good books out of Latin
or Greek into English, for the use and commodity of such as are
rude and ignorant of the said tongues. It is now no news in
England to see young damsels in noble houses, and in the Courts
of princes, instead of cards and other instruments of idle trifling,
to have continually in their hands either psalms, homilies, or
other devout meditations, or else Paul’s Epistles or some book of
Holy Scripture matters, and as familiarly both to read and reason
thereof in Greek, Latin, French, or Italian, as in English.</p>
</div>

<p>Dr. Wotton, in his “Reflections upon Ancient and
Modern Learning,” says that “learning was so very modish
then, that the fair sex seemed to believe that Greek and
Latin added to their charms. Plato and Aristotle untranslated
were the frequent ornaments of their closets.
One would think by its effects that it was a proper way
of educating them, since there are no accounts in history
of so many great women in any one age as are to be found
between the years fifteen and sixteen hundred.”</p>

<p>Amid all the discussions over the causes of the great
outburst of literature in the sixteenth century I have never
noted any one allude to the fact that the cultivation of the
<i>mothers</i> paved the way for the higher development of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
sons. Sir Thomas Elyot, who wrote “The Defence of
Good Women” (1545), also advised his sister, Margery
Puttenham, on the bringing up of her children, Margery,
Richard, and George who wrote “The Art of English
Poesie.”</p>

<p>Lyly dedicated his “Euphues” to the ladies and gentlewomen
of England, a work which more than any other
one volume refined the old and moulded the later English
speech; Shakespeare wrote of, and to, cultivated women;
numerous ladies were patronesses of struggling authors,
and nearly every poet of the time has his dedication to,
if not his adoration of, some peerless woman. The very
delicacy and power of the poems on the passion of love
bear witness to the culture of the women as well as that
of the men: for example, the “Amoretti” of Spenser.</p>

<p>Two causes, besides the inspiration of the reforming
spirit of the age, may be considered in regard to the advance
of Englishwomen. The first was the association of
the sexes in so many spheres. Foreign ambassadors note
of the women that they go everywhere with their husbands,
even to outdoor sports, such as hunting and hawking.
In the semi-religious guilds established for good
fellowship and a community of good works through life,
and common prayers for each other at death, the initial
and nobler forerunner of the modern <i>Club</i>, women joined
freely in equal numbers and with privileges equal to men,
the same standard of morality being demanded from
each.</p>

<p>Most of the trade guilds were open to women by inheritance
or by apprenticeship, and all were open to the
widows of freemen. Women went to all the guild dinners
with their male relatives; they went to the secret Bible
readings, to the public sermons, and when the time came,
to the theatres.</p>

<p>The other cause lay in the fact that the higher education<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
of women was distinctly <i>fashionable</i>. I do not think that
the reason it became so has ever been sufficiently realized.</p>

<p>Our natural detestation of Spanish religious intolerance
and our political rivalry with Spain have blinded our eyes
to much that we owed to that country. The widening of
our geographical horizon seemed to stimulate and suggest
new poetic ideas. There is no doubt that the English
Sebastian Cabot did much for his country, but a greater
halo of romance and wonder floated over the sails of
Columbus that bore him to the golden islands of the
Spanish Main. But women, as a sex, owed something
more to Spain than the dreams of El Dorado, for thence
came, early in the century, the noble but unfortunate
Queen Katharine of Aragon. It was her intelligent culture
that first made the higher education of women <i>fashionable</i>
in the best sense of the word. She was the youngest of
the four distinguished daughters of the “Ferdinand and
Isabella to whom Columbus gave a new world.” Isabella
was the most learned woman of her time, and she had
taken special care of the education of her daughters.</p>

<p>When Katharine came to England as the affianced bride
of Prince Arthur, the greatest lady in the land was the
King’s mother, Margaret, the Countess of Richmond and
Derby. She was a woman of wonderful abilities, with a
tenacious memory and a piercing wit. She spoke French
fluently, and had some acquaintance with Latin, but she
always regretted that in her youth she had not made herself
mistress of that language. She was very pious. About
the beginning of the sixteenth century she translated out
of French a Latin book called “The Mirroure of Gold for
the Sinful Soul,” and “The Fourth Book of Dr. John
Gerson’s Treatise of the Imitation and Following the Life
of Christ.” She also commanded other translations, was a
patroness of learned men, founded lectureships, schools,
colleges, almshouses, and decided and wrote down the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
orders for state etiquette and the management of the
Royal household.</p>

<p>But the culture of Katharine was more varied and
liberal, and during the period of her supremacy she did
much to mould the tastes of the Court. Everything that
was best in Henry responded to her influence; it was only
when he turned from her that his character began to
change for the worse. Learned men sought her Court
and her favour. Erasmus dedicated to her his book on
“Christian Matrimony,” Ludovico Vives his work on
“Education.”</p>

<p>The first sixteenth-century woman student of whose
training we have any clear information was her sole surviving
daughter, Mary Tudor, born 18 February 1515-16.
The third day after, she was christened, confirmed, and
proclaimed Princess. Not only had she a nurse selected
in Catharine, wife of Leonard Pole, Esq., but a “Lady
Maistress,” or governess, in Lady Margaret Bryan, a lady
of great good sense and ability. The Countess of Salisbury
was made State governess and head of her household.</p>

<p>Dr. Linacre, the learned physician, who had formerly
been one of Prince Arthur’s tutors, was appointed her
physician and her instructor in Latin. He wrote a Latin
grammar for the child’s use, which seems crabbed enough
to modern minds of riper years, and dedicated it to her
with a complimentary preface, in which he speaks with
praise of her docility and love of learning. This is all the
more remarkable when we remember that Linacre died
when she was eight years old. Lilly, who brought out
later editions of this grammar, added his praises to those
of Linacre. To Queen Katharine we may be said to owe
the first treatise on the “Theory of Education for Women.”</p>

<p>Ludovico Vives, born 1492 in Valentia, who was accounted
one of the three most learned men in Europe, was
one of her correspondents. Knowing her desire to educate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
her daughter wisely, he published a treatise on the “Education
of a Christian Woman” (1523), and dedicated it to
her as the most learned woman of her age. (This was
translated into English, and published in 1541, thus becoming
the guide to many sixteenth-century mothers.)
Queen Katharine asked him to draw up a special further
course of study for her daughter, which he did. His works
are even yet well worthy of study.</p>

<p>He considers the intellects of women inferior to those
of men, but he would not on that account refuse them instruction,
which they needed the more to develop their
character. He said that a learned woman rarely or never
failed in virtue. He did not fix the age at which they
should commence to learn, but remarked that they should
learn sewing and knitting at the same time as reading.
He is not particular whether they begin their serious study
in their sixth or seventh year, but of the seriousness of the
study there is no doubt—in science, philosophy, and languages.
He knows hard work is not agreeable to all
women, any more than it is to all men. He does not speak
of Art: there was no Art-culture in his day beyond illuminations
and embroidery; but, strange to say, he does
consider <i>hygiene</i>, air, exercise, the amount of sleep necessary,
the due <i>hardness</i> of the bed. He has a chapter on
decoration, and says hard things of the face-painting of
the period. “How can a woman weep for her sins, when
her tears would stain her face?” She should not over-dress.
(He blamed the painters who represented the Virgin
Mary with robes of silk and ornaments.) She should have
no affectation, she should be modest in society, but when
she does talk she should be able to talk well. Her parents
should choose her husband; affection will come after marriage.
But he disapproved of precocious marriages, and
thought seventeen or eighteen years the lowest age possible.
There ought to be no rejoicings at a marriage, because the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
results are very uncertain. He gives advice regarding
servants, showing that the domestic troubles of to-day
existed even then. A woman should know a little medicine,
so as not to call in the doctor and apothecary continually.
Even a girl should set aside an hour daily for
meditation and prayer. She should read the Gospels and
the Fathers; for recreation, moral stories, such as stories
from the Bible, from Papyrius in Aulus Gellius, of Lucretia
in Livy, and of the patient Griselda, but <i>no romances</i>.</p>

<p>The “Index Expurgatorius” that he gives is interesting
to the bibliographer:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The laws ought to take heed of such ungratious books, such as
be in my countrey of Spain, “Amadis,” “Florisande,” “Tirante,”
“Tristram and Celestina,” “Le Prison d’Amour.” In France
“Lancelot du Lac,” “Paris and Vienna,” “Pontus and Sidonia,”
“Pierre de Provence,” and “Melusyne.” In Flanders “Flory and
White Flower,” “Leonella and Canamour,” “Curias and Floreta,”
“Pyramus and Thisbe.” In England “Parthenope,” “Genarides,”
“Hippomadon,” Wylliam and Meliour, Livius, Arthur, Guye,
Bevis and many other, and many translated out of Latin; the
“Facetiæ Poggii,” “Euryalus and Lucretia,” and the “Hundred
Tales of Boccaccio,” in Italy:</p>

<p>Of maids some be but little mete for lernyng lykewise as some
men be unapte, agayne, some be even borne unto it, or at least
not unfit for it. Therefore they that be dulle are not to be discouraged,
and those that be apt should be harted and encouraged.
She that hath learned in books hath furnished and fenced her
mind with holy counsels.</p>
</div>

<p>He gives among examples of women good and learned:
Portia, the wife of Brutus; Cleobula, daughter of Cleobulas;
and the daughter of Pythagoras, who, after his
death, became the ruler of his school.</p>

<p>Ludovico Vives was invited in 1523 to come to lecture
at Oxford and to superintend the education of Princess
Mary. This he did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span></p>

<p>She went to live at Oxford to be near him, and therefore
was the first woman student in that university town.
His lessons to the Princess were so interesting that the
King and Queen often came to Oxford to listen.</p>

<p>He says a girl ought to be taught to pronounce clearly,
and every day commit something to memory and read
over before retiring to rest. He allows the use of a Latin
dictionary, recommends translation from English into
Latin, and conversations in Latin with her preceptor. He
advises the learning by heart of the “Distiches” of Cato,
the “Sentences” of Publius Syrus, and the “Seven Sages
of Greece,” lately collected and published by Erasmus.
The course of reading drawn up included Cicero, Seneca,
Plutarch; some dialogues of Plato, particularly those of a
political turn; Jerome’s “Epistle”; part of St. Ambrose
and St. Augustine; the “Enchiridion,” “Institutio Principis”;
the “Paraphrases” of Erasmus; and the “Utopia”
of Sir Thomas More; a portion of the New Testament to
be read morning and evening, and of the Christian poets,
Prudentius Sydonius, Paulinus, Arator, Prosper, and Juvencus,
as well as Lucan, Seneca, and a part of Horace.
Before selections such as these even a modern candidate
for classical honours might feel nervous.</p>

<p>Poor little Princess! With these grave studies and serious
maxims were her natural high spirits toned down to meet
her melancholy fate. She proved an “apt” student and
prospered in her work, being encouraged and guided by her
loving mother, who delighted in revising her Latin exercises
and criticizing her style. Many learned men watched
her progress with interest. Lord Morley, one of the literary
nobles of the day, dedicated a book to her at the time of
her fallen fortunes, when men were little likely to overestimate
her powers, in which he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I do well remember that skant ye were come to twelve yeres of
age, but that ye were so rype in the Latin tonge, that rathe dothe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>

rede, wright, and constrewe Laten, but farthermore translate
eny harde thinge of the Latin into ower Englyshe tonge.</p>
</div>

<p>And he refers with praise to one of her works she had
given him.</p>

<p>The translation itself, preserved in a missal, is entitled,
“The prayer of Saynt Thomas of Aquine, translatyd oute
of Latin ynto Englyshe by ye moste exselent Prynses
Mary daughter to the most hygh and myghtie Prynce and
Prynces Kyng Henry the VIII <i>and Quene Kateryn his
wyfe</i>. In the yere of oure Lorde God 1527, and the xi yere
of her age.” (See Cott. MS., Vesp. E, xiii, f. 72.)</p>

<p>That her studies were not limited to Latin we see in the
quaint verses of William Forrest, priest:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>Anthonie Crispin, Lord of Milherbe, a French gentleman

about her:</p>

<p>The wonder of the records of her learning is increased
when we remember the frequent overtures of marriage that
were laid before her, which must somewhat have occupied
her thoughts, also the extraordinary fluctuations of her
fortunes. The demands upon her hours, in the time both
of her prosperity and adversity, must have been great. In
1525, when the Emperor broke off his engagement to her
to marry Isabel of Portugal, she was sent to hold High
Court with viceregal splendour, as the first Princess of
Wales at Ludlow Castle. There she stayed for eighteen
months. The Countess of Salisbury was still her State
governess, and Mr. Featherstone her Latin tutor. She did
not keep strictly to the advice of the prudent Vives; for
she gave considerable time to dancing and playing on the
virginals, and in her privy purse expenses there are many
entries of her losses when <i>playing at cards</i>. On her return
to her father’s Court, she is recorded not only to have
danced with him, but to have danced in the ballets, and
acted in the Court masques of the day, as well as in one of
the comedies of Terence. It was a new and hitherto unheard-of
proceeding for Royal ladies to appear as stage
performers, but the example seems to have been followed.
(Mary was always devoted to the Drama, and spent more
on it in a year than did either her father or her sister.) In
her sudden fall from her high estate, she relinquished only
her gaieties, but continued her studies, including domestic
economy, inculcated by Vives. Mary was restored to Court
favour after the death of Anne Boleyn, and was on friendly
terms with her later stepmothers, especially Katharine
Parr. At the request of the latter she undertook the translation
of the Latin paraphrase of St. John by Erasmus into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
the English language. She meant to have translated more,
but an attack of illness laid her aside. Her rendering of
St. John was printed and published in the same volume
with the translations of the other paraphrases of Erasmus
by the celebrated reformers, Kay, Cox, Udall, Old, and
Allen, though her name was not affixed to the first edition.</p>

<p>Among her scientific tastes was the study of botany, and
she imported many foreign plants and trees, striving to
naturalize them. She also had a special interest in clock-making,
like her relative Charles V. This was not, in her
time, so commonplace a manufacture as it is to-day. Her
value for time, and the exact measurement thereof, carry
us back in thought to the days of her predecessor Alfred,
with his candle-measured hours.</p>

<p>Prepared as she was for the throne, the misfortunes of
her life make us almost believe in the power of evil stars.
Her period of depression lasted too long for her health and
spirits; the doctrine of the virtue of irresponsible feminine
obedience prevented her from ever showing her true nature,
except once. Her courage and prudence at the <i>coup d’état</i>
of Northumberland, her clemency afterwards, show what
she might have been had she been allowed to act independently,
as did the second royal student of the century.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was born on 7th September 1533. Her stars
were fortunate, and the moon shone full upon her birth.
Her physical health was excellent; her period of depression
lasted just long enough to steady her flighty spirits and
elevate her character. She was fortunate in the kind sympathy
of Katharine Parr, that excellent and learned woman,
who showed a genius for fulfilling wisely and tenderly the
difficult duties of a stepmother. Elizabeth is said to have
been very precocious, learning Latin, French, Italian, and
music without difficulty. In a letter of the Princess Mary
to her father, Henry VIII, 21 July 1536, she says: “My
sister Elizabeth is well, and such a child toward as I doubt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
not but your Highness shall have cause to rejoice of in
time coming.” She was four years old when her brother
Edward was born, and Sir John Cheke, being appointed his
tutor, sometimes gave her lessons. She was once reading
with him when Leland called, and her tutor desired her to
address the antiquary in Latin. She immediately did so,
and the old scholar in return addressed to her four Latin
verses of genuine admiration. By the age of twelve she
had considerably advanced in history and geography, understood
the principles of architecture, mathematics, and
astronomy, was fond of poetry, and studied politics as a
duty. She had a talent for languages, speaking French,
Italian, Spanish, and Flemish with facility. Her tutor
Ascham tells us what she had done in classics before she
was sixteen. She had read almost the whole of Cicero
and a great part of Livy, some of the Fathers, especially
“St. Cyprian on the Training of a Maiden.” The select
orations of Isocrates and the tragedies of Sophocles were
her Greek text-books. During Mary’s reign Ascham wrote
to John Sturmius:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Lady Elizabeth and I are studying together, in the original
Greek, the crown orations of Demosthenes and Æschines. She
reads her lessons to me, and at one glance so completely comprehends
not only the idiom of the language and the sense of the
orator, but the exact bearings of the cause and the public acts,
manners, and usages of the Athenian people that you would
marvel to behold her.</p>
</div>

<p>In addition to the tongues, she studied rhetoric, philosophy,
and divinity, and history remained her favourite
study. In Ascham’s “Scholemaster,” which was not published
until after his death, he praised her as being far
above the ordinary university students. Scaliger declared
that she knew more than any of the great men of her
time, which was certainly flattery. But there are many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
apparently genuine anecdotes of her prompt replies to
foreign ambassadors in their own tongue or in Latin.</p>

<p>During her happy years with her brother Edward she
shared his studies and read with him the Scriptures. He
called her his “sweet sister Temperance,” probably in allusion
to that name in John Hall’s “Court of Virtue,” in
which, instead of the heathen muses, the Christian virtues
are grouped around their Queen.</p>

<p>Elizabeth appears early not only as a student but as an
<i>author</i>. Much of the literature of the period was translation.
At the age of twelve she rendered out of English into
Latin, French, and Italian the prayers and meditations collected
out of prime writers by Queen Katharine Parr.
About the same time she translated as a treatise, published
in 1548, the “Godly Meditation of the Christian Soule,
compiled in French by Lady Margaret, Queen of Navarre,
aptlie translated into English by the ryght vertuous Lady
Elizabeth, daughter to our Soveraigne Lord King Henrie
the VIII.” Appended to this was her metrical rendering
of the fourteenth Psalm; and thus, curiously enough, Queen
Elizabeth appears as the versifier of the first metrical Psalm
printed <i>with date</i>. This little volume was reprinted in
1595, again in Bentley’s “Monument of Matrons,” and a
facsimile edition was brought out by Dr. Percy Ames in
1897. Other verses are ascribed to her, and translations
from Boethius and Plutarch.</p>

<p>Elizabeth studied politics far more deeply than her sister;
she remained unmarried; her frivolity and flirtation
often veiled astute statecraft; she kept Lord Burleigh as
her adviser, and fortune gave her health and a long life.
She guided her country, through the difficult tides of the
Reformation, into the harbour of prosperity and peace, and
her people glorified her name. She inherited the great men
born in her sister’s short reign, and other great men
hastened to be born just after her accession. All other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
reigns put together do not contribute so much to the great
Literature of the world.</p>

<p>These two remarkable sisters had two remarkable
cousins, who may be called their political victims, destined
to be so through the action of Henry VIII concerning the
succession, which “made confusion worse confounded.” But
it is only as <i>students</i> that I now discuss them.</p>

<p>Lady Jane Grey (1537-1553-4) was eldest daughter of
the new Duke of Suffolk, and Frances, eldest daughter of
Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, and Mary, daughter of
Henry VII. She had a fine genius, and she was carefully
educated under the care of Mr. Aylmer, afterwards Bishop
of London. Ballard says of her:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>She understood perfectly both kinds of philosophy, and could
express herself very properly in the Latin and Greek tongues.
Sir Thomas Chaloner, her contemporary, says she was well versed
in Hebrew, Chaldee, Arabic, French, and Italian. She played
instrumental music well with a curious hand, and was excellent at
her needle.</p>
</div>

<p>Roger Ascham, Queen Elizabeth’s tutor, tells a story of
her. When he called on her to take leave before he went
abroad, he found that the Duke and Duchess and all their
household were hunting in the park.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I found her in the chamber reading “Phaedon Platonis,” in
Greek. I asked her why she preferred this to the sport in the
park, and she answered: “One of the greatest benefits that God
ever gave me, is, that He sent me so sharp and severe parents,
and so gentle a schoolmaster.”</p>
</div>

<p>She described how sharply they checked and corrected
her, so that she wearied for the time to come that she must
go to Mr. Aylmer,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p0">who teacheth me so gently, so pleasantly, and with such fair
allurements to learning, that I think the time all nothing while I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
am with him, and when I am called from him I fall on weeping,
because, whatever I do else but learning is full of grief, trouble,
fear, and whole misliking unto me. And thus my book hath been
so much my pleasure, that all other pleasures be but trifles and
very troubles unto me.</p>
</div>

<p>Foxe says of her:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If her fortune had been but as good as her bringing up, joyned
with fineness of wit, she might have been comparable ... not
only to any other women that deserveth high praise for their
singular learning, but also to the university men, which have taken
many degrees of the schools.</p>
</div>

<p>The young king was devoted to her, and his personal
affection prepared him to fall in with Northumberland’s
designs to induce him to leave the crown to her. Her own
judgment declared in favour of the accession of Mary, and
she did not wish a crown for herself. It was through obedience
to her parents only that she submitted to be proclaimed,
and went to the Tower as Queen, to remain as
prisoner. Mary was inclined to deal gently with her; she
let her father go off scot-free. But when he associated himself
anew with Wyat’s rising, he sealed not only his own
fate, but that of his daughter.</p>

<p>The Lady Jane was one of the few who, having grasped
and accepted the principles of Protestantism, remained firm
at the hour of trial. Mary, anxious to convert her, sent her
former tutor, then her chaplain, Feckenham, afterwards
Abbot of Westminster, to discuss religious questions with
her. Her firm and clear replies showed her acuteness and
trained habits of thought, as well as the purity of her faith.
She is the most wonderful illustration of that strange distinction
between the cultured girls of that period and of our
own—their early maturity in thought and action. Compare
the tender, dignified, and tragic picture of the ten days’
queen, of little more than sixteen years of age, with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
average upper-class High School girl of to-day of the same
age, and no more need be said of sixteenth-century education
and its results.</p>

<p>Dr. Fuller says of her:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>She had the innocency of childhood, the beauty of youth, the
solidity of middle-age, the gravity of old age, and all at sixteen;
the birth of a princess, the learning of a clerk, the life of a saint,
yet the death of a malefactor for her parents’ offences.</p>
</div>

<p>Youngest, fairest, and most unfortunate of the four remarkable
cousins, Marie Stuart, born 1542, a queen at a
week old, is more remembered for the charm of her personality
than for her scholarship. More has been thought
and written about her than about all the other queens of
the century put together. Opinions are divided about her
character, and I dare not touch the question now. But of
her native genius and aptitude for study there is no doubt.
The little Princess, with her four Maries, had even in the
charming and sequestered island of Inchmahome, before
she was six years old, commenced her studies in Latin,<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
French, Spanish, and Italian. Henry VIII wished to marry
her to his son Edward VI, and sent an army with fire and
sword to fetch her. The Scots “had no objection to the
marriage, but misliked the manner of such rough wooing,”
and sent her off to France, accompanied by her governess,
Lady Fleming, and her four Maries, “Marie Beaton, Marie
Seaton, Marie Carmichael, and <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>There her studies were directed by Margaret, the sister of
Henry II of France, one of the most accomplished and learned
ladies of her time. The little Princess delighted in work, in
religion, and was most amenable to discipline. She learned
Greek and Italian with facility, but was not taught English
or Scotch, that French might be paramount in her heart.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
Her Latin exercises in 1554 have been printed by the Warton
Club. Her skill in elocution delighted the French
Court, when in 1554 she gave a Latin oration. The subject
she chose was intensely suggestive—“The Praise of Learned
Ladies.” In this she stated her opinion that women were
able to excel in anything if they only had an opportunity
given them. She was fond of poetry, in which Ronsard
taught her to essay her powers, had a taste for music,
played well on several instruments, was a fine dancer, a
graceful rider, and delighted in needlework. Accomplishments
so varied are rarely found in one person. She married
the Dauphin in 1558; his father died in 1559, and she
became Queen, but her husband died in 1560. Fortune
dealt hardly with her; her lot was cast in times too difficult
for her and in circumstances discordant with her
education.</p>

<p>Katharine Parr (1509-1548) was the elder daughter of
Sir Thomas Parr, of Kendal, and Dame Maud, his wife,
“who, following the example of Sir Thomas More and
other great men, bestowed on her a learned education, as
the most valuable addition he could make to her other
charms.” She had been married twice before she became
Queen, 12 July 1543, and was fortunate enough to survive
her husband. She wrote several religious books and translations,
and procured several learned persons to translate
Erasmus’s “Paraphrase of the New Testament,” one of
whom was her stepdaughter, the Princess Mary. She was
deeply interested in the religious questions of the day, and
very nearly suffered with Anne Askew. The Bishop of
Winchester and Chancellor Wriothesley had conspired
against her so artfully, persuading the King that she set
up her judgement against his, that he had signed the
warrant for her arrest. Warned by a friend, she so skilfully
explained matters to the King, that his love and trust returned,
and he reproached Wriothesley. The King left her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
Regent of the country when he went abroad, and she fulfilled
her duties well; and her skill in nursing alleviated his
sufferings till his death.</p>

<p>Anne Askew (1520-1546) was the daughter of Sir William
Askew, of Kelsay in Lincolnshire, who educated her liberally,
but married her against her will to Mr. Kyme. She
demeaned herself as a Christian wife; but when, through
reading the Scriptures, she saw the force of the Protestant
doctrines, her husband drove her from his home and informed
against her. She was seized, dragged before the
Inquisitor, Christopher Dare, examined, brought before the
King’s Council, tried at Guildhall, and condemned as a
heretic, though she defended herself skilfully. They put
her to the rack to find the names of other ladies of her
opinion. She bore it, and was silent, and was burned on
16th July 1546. And this was the fate the last wife of
Henry VIII escaped.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas More, Lord High Chancellor of England,
preferred knowledge to all other riches. Erasmus wrote to
a friend in Italy:</p>

<p>What is it, you say, which captivates me so much in England?
It is because I have found a pleasant and salubrious air: I have
met with humanity, politeness, and learning; learning not trite
and superficial, but deep and accurate—true old Greek and Latin
learning. When Colet discourses, I seem to hear Plato himself:
In Grocyn I admire a universal compass of learning: Linacre’s
acuteness, depth, and accuracy are not to be exceeded; nor did
Nature ever form anything more elegant, exquisite, and accomplished
than Sir Thomas More.</p>
</div>

<p>In a well-known letter to a friend about the choice of a
wife Sir Thomas says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>May she be learned, if possible, or at least capable of being
made so! A woman thus accomplished will be always drawing
sentences and maxims of virtue out of the best authors of antiquity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
She will infuse knowledge into your children with their milk and
train them up in wisdom.</p>
</div>

<p>Such wives did he prepare his own daughters to be;
Margaret Roper, Elizabeth Dancy, and Cecilia Heron.
Erasmus described their home at Chelsea as a “little academe
combined with a university of Christian religion.”
The favourite was the eldest, Margaret (1508-44), who
was most like her father. He procured some of the best
linguists of the age to teach her the learned languages, as
Dr. Clement and Mr. William Gonell, and other great
masters to instruct her in the liberal arts and sciences,
philosophy, logic, rhetoric, music, mathematics, astronomy,
and arithmetic. Her letters and orations delighted the
most learned of her contemporaries, as the great Cardinal
Pole, John Voysey, Bishop of Exeter, and Erasmus, who
called her “the ornament of Britain.” The tutor of the
Duke of Richmond wrote to Sir Thomas More to express
his regret that he had not been present when his daughter
“disputed of philosophy before the King.” The love and
tenderness of her father were equal to his wisdom, and the
story of their lives is ideally beautiful. When she married
Mr. William Roper, of Eltham, Kent, he kept up communion
in correspondence. In one letter he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Farewell, dearest daughter, and commend me kindly to your
husband, my loving sonne, who maketh me rejoice that he studieth
the same things as you do, and whereas I am wont to counsel you
to give place to your husband, now on the other side I give you
licence to maister him in the knowledge of the spheres. Commend
me to all your schoolfellows and to your maister especially.</p>
</div>

<p>She wrote and translated many works, especially Eusebius’s
“Ecclesiastical History” out of Greek into Latin,
which her daughter, Mary Roper, another learned student,
translated afterwards out of Latin into English.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span></p>

<p>Leland the antiquary writes of Sir Thomas More’s
daughters, verses translated thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The purest Latin authors were their joy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They loved in Rome’s politest style to write</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And with the choicest eloquence indite.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor were they conversant alone in these</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They turned o’er Homer and Demosthenes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From Aristotle’s Store of Learning too</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The mystic Art of reasoning well they drew.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Then blush ye men, if you neglect to trace</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Those heights of learning which the Females grace.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Associated with them in their life and studies was Margaret
Giggs (1508-70), a niece of Sir Thomas More. She is included
in both of Holbein’s portrait-groups of the More
family, and was also distinguished for her aptitude in
learning. Algebra was her special study, and Sir Thomas
More sent an algorism stone of hers from the Tower. She
married their family tutor, Dr. John Clement, and Leland
wrote her epithalamium. Her husband made her little inferior
to himself in Latin and Greek, and she assisted him
in his translations. She and her husband went abroad on
Elizabeth’s accession. Her only daughter, Winifred, married
William Rastell, nephew of Sir Thomas More.</p>

<p>Sir Anthony Cooke, one of the learned tutors of
Edward VI, also gave his daughters an education so
liberal that they became the wonder of their age. He considered
that women should be educated on the same lines
as men, and that they were quite as fit. Mildred (1526-89),
was well skilled in the Greek and Latin tongues, particularly
Greek. She delighted in reading the works of Basil the
Great, Cyril Chrysostom, Gregory Nazianzen, and other
similar writers. She translated part of St. Chrysostom into
English. When she presented the Cambridge University
Library with a great Bible in Hebrew and other languages,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
she sent with it a Greek letter. In 1546 she married Sir
William Cecil, afterwards Lord Burleigh, and became the
mother of Anne Countess of Oxford, and Robert Cecil,
afterwards Earl of Salisbury. Her marriage was happy,
and after her death her husband wrote “Meditations”
upon her goodness, her private charity and helps to
learning.</p>

<p>Anne, born 1528, second daughter of Sir Anthony Cooke,
was also liberally educated, and distinguished among the
<i>literati</i> of the time. She was said to be “a choice lady,
eminent for piety, virtue, and learning, and exquisitely
skilled in the Greek, Latin, and Italian tongues,” and was
associated with her father by being made governess to
King Edward VI. She translated out of Italian into English
twenty-five sermons written by Bernardino Ochino,
1550. She also rendered out of Latin into English Bishop
Jewel’s “Apology for the Church of England,” for which
she had great praise from the author and the Archbishop.
“Besides the honour done to her sex, and to the degree of
ladies, she had done pleasure to the author of the Latin
book, by delivering him by her clear translation from the
perils of ambiguous and doubtful constructions.” She
married Sir Nicholas Bacon, Lord Keeper of the Great
Seal, and had two sons, Anthony and Francis, whose great
powers she cultivated from their earliest years.</p>

<p>Elizabeth, born 1529, third daughter of Sir Anthony
Cooke, was also learned in languages and sciences. She
translated out of French a tract on transubstantiation,
afterwards printed, and was consulted by all the learned
men of her age. She married, first, Sir Thomas Hoby,
Ambassador in France; and second, Lord John Russel, son
and heir to the Earl of Bedford, and carefully educated her
children.</p>

<p>Katherine, born 1530, fourth daughter of Sir Anthony
Cooke, was also famous for learning in Hebrew, Greek,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
Latin, and for her skill in poetry. A specimen of her
talent is preserved in Sir John Harington’s notes to his
“Ariosto,” and by Dr. Thomas Fuller in his “Worthies of
England” (328). Probably a certain timidity of his own
powers in this accomplishment induced one of her admirers
to employ George Buchanan to write verses for him. These
appear among George Buchanan’s epigrams and three short
poems, “To the learned daughter of Sir Anthony Cooke,
in the name of Henry Killigrew, Englishman.” This gentleman
she afterwards married.</p>

<p>The three daughters of the unfortunate Duke of Somerset,
Protector of England, under Edward VI, Lady Anne, Lady
Margaret, and Lady Jane, were also widely famed for their
learning and culture. They wrote 400 Latin verses on the
death of Margaret of Valois, the Queen of Navarre, and it
was said of them by Ronsard that if Orpheus had heard
them sing, he would have become their scholar.</p>

<p>Lady Jane, the eldest daughter of the famous poet the
Earl of Surrey, who married the unfortunate Charles
Neville, Earl of Westmoreland, was a distinguished
scholar. Foxe, the Martyrologist, was her tutor, and he
said of her that “she might well stand in competition with
the most learned men of the time, for the praise of elegancy
both in Greek and Latin.”</p>

<p>Henry, Lord Maltravers, only son of the Earl of Arundel,
one of the few representatives left of the ancient nobility,
excelled in all manner of good learning and languages, and
gave a learned education to his son and his two daughters,
Mary, Duchess of Norfolk, and Jane, Lady Lumley. Mary
translated selections from Greek into Latin, and Jane,
“Isocrates,” the “Iphigenia” of Euripides and others referred
to in Ascham’s “Schoolmaster.” Their exercise-books
of translations are still preserved in the Royal MSS.
The former died at the age of sixteen, after she had given
birth to Philip, afterwards Earl of Arundel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span></p>

<p>Mary, daughter of Sir Thomas Arundel, who was first
married to Robert Ratcliff, secondly to Henry Howard,
Earl of Arundel, was also a distinguished scholar. She
translated from English into Latin “The Wise Sayings and
Eminent Deeds of the Emperor Alexander Severus.” She
also translated from Greek into Latin select “Sentences of
the Seven Wise Grecian Philosophers,” and “Similes collected
from the Books of Plato, Aristotle, Seneca, and other
Philosophers.” These she dedicated to her father.</p>

<p>Lady Elizabeth Fane, wife of Sir Ralph Fane (who was
sent to the Tower with the Duke of Somerset and suffered
with him in 1551), was thoroughly educated, after the
fashion of her time, though not so brilliant as many of her
contemporaries. She translated and versified 21 Psalms
and 102 Proverbs in English, printed by Robert Crowland,
1550.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Jane Weston, born about 1558, was gifted with
fine talent, which was highly cultivated. She left England
young, and settled in Prague. She wrote several Latin
books in prose and verse, highly esteemed by the learned
men of the time. She is ranked on the Continent with Sir
Thomas More and the best Latin poets of the century, was
highly praised by Scaliger, and complimented by Nicholas
May in a Latin epigram. She married Mr. John Leon, a
gentleman of the Emperor’s Court.</p>

<p>Catherine Tishem was a great linguist, and could read
Galen in the original, which few physicians of her time
could do. She married Gualterus Gruter of Antwerp, and
was the chief instructor of her son John Gruter the famous
philologist.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Legge, born 1580, was noted for her faculty
of acquiring languages, having studied thoroughly the Latin,
French, Spanish, and <i>Irish</i> tongues, besides cultivating her
poetical powers. Unfortunately, she could not make use of
her acquirements, as she lost her sight in consequence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
severe study. She never married, lived chiefly in Ireland,
and died at the age of 105.</p>

<p>Ballard also mentions Esther Inglis as a scholar, though
she is chiefly noted for her beautiful handwriting, which is
preserved in the British Museum.</p>

<p>Many ladies of the century were known as writers, as
Elizabeth Grimeston, and more as patrons of literature.
But by far the greatest woman author of the later century
was Mary, sister of Sir Philip Sidney, and wife of the Earl
of Pembroke. She was carefully educated in Latin, Greek,
and Hebrew, and shared her distinguished brother’s literary
tastes. She was married in 1577, and her eldest son, William,
was born in 1580. About that time Sir Philip Sidney was
in disfavour at Court, and stayed with her at Wilton House,
where was a good library. They retired together in the
summer to a small house at Ivychurch, where they continued
their literary pursuits. Two years afterwards Sir
Philip dedicated to her his romance, “the Countess of
Pembroke’s Arcadia,” first printed by Ponsonby. She did
not like it as it stood, so corrected and expanded it much,
and republished it. She also translated a “Discourse upon
Life and Death” from the French of Plessis du Mornay,
her brother’s friend, published 1590; and rendered very
freely into English blank verse Robert Garnier’s French
tragedy of Marcus Antonius, adding choral lyrics of her
own. Some of the passages are finer than anything her
brother produced. She edited and published her brother’s
poems after his death, and completed the metrical translation
of the Psalms which he had begun, and worked up to
the forty-third, but she did not publish these. They lie in
the British Museum, Add. MSS., 12047-8. She lost her
father in May, her mother in August, and her brother in
October 1586. She expressed her sorrow for his loss in a
poem published by Spenser with his “Astrophel” (1595), and
awkwardly named by him “The Dolefull Lay of Clorinda.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span></p>

<p>Spenser says of her in “Colin Clout’s Come Home
Again”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Urania sister unto Astrophel</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In whose brave mind as in a golden coffer</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All heavenly gifts and riches locked are</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">More rich than pearls of Ind, or gold of Ophir,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And in her sex more wonderful and rare.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In a dedicatory sonnet to “The Faery Queene” he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Your brother’s goodly image lives</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the divine resemblance of your face.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and elsewhere he repeats:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The gentlest shepherdess that lived that day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And most resembling in shape and spirit</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her brother dear.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He dedicates to her also his “Ruines of Time,” in which
he praises her brother.</p>

<p>Abraham Fraunce extols her, and produces “The
Countess of Pembroke’s Ivychurch, 1591,” and “The
Countess of Pembroke’s Emmanuel.”</p>

<p>The poet Daniel became tutor to her sons, and to her he
dedicated his “Delia,” a collection of sonnets (1592), and
his tragedy of “Cleopatra” as companion to her “Mark
Antony.”</p>

<p>Thomas Nash says of her, in prefatory lines to the 1591
edition of Sidney’s “Astrophel”: “The artes do adore her
as a second Minerva, and our poets extol her as patroness
of their inventions.” Osborne says of her:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>She was that sister of Sir Philip Sidney’s to whom he addressed
his “Arcadia,” and of whom he had no advantage but what he
received from the partial benevolence of Fortune in making him
a man.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span></p>

<p>Meres compares her to Octavia, Augustus’ sister and
Virgil’s patroness; and describes her as being not only
liberal to poets but a most delicate poet, worthy of the
complimentary lines which Antipholus Sidonius addressed
to Sappho.</p>

<p>Thomas Churchyard writes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Pembroke a Pearl that orient is of kind,</div>

<p>She died in 1621, and her family raised no monument to
her, but Ben Jonson wrote the famous epitaph:</p>

</div>

<p>Arabella Stewart, born 1577, the daughter of Charles
Stewart Lennox, the youngest brother of Lord Darnley,
was a very highly cultured woman, and was appointed by
her cousin, James I, to be governess to his daughter the
Princess Elizabeth, who loved her dearly. She wrote
histories and had a great facility for poetical composition.</p>

<p>Two other names I would like to mention of ladies born
in the sixteenth century, who carried into the next its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
culture with a difference, as the new spirit of science and
mathematics, history, and political economy absorbed some
of the time hitherto devoted to classics.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Stewart, mentioned above, was born in 1596, at
Falkland Palace. When her father came to England she
was sent to the charge of Lord Harington at Coombe
Abbey, Warwickshire. That nobleman followed the plan of
Sir David Lindsay, of the Mount, surrounded her by cultured
companions, explained to her the meaning of everything,
and taught her the foundations of the Christian religion.
Mr. Beauchamp was her writing master, and the
famous Dr. Bull, the composer, her teacher in music. Lord
Harington himself taught her much in history, literature,
and geography. She was very fond of animals and of natural
history, and she had a little corner of the park, with a lake
in it, to preserve her treasures. She built a little cottage
for a widow and her children to attend to her animals, and
designed it herself. Near it was her fairy farm, with the
smallest kind of cattle that could be bought. She studied
the changes of insects through the microscope, then newly
invented. When ten years old a portrait was painted of
her, inexplicable without knowing all this. She has a
monkey and a dog at her feet, a love-bird in her hand, a
macaw on one shoulder and a parrot on the other. She was
familiar also with the use of the telescope, and studied
mathematics and astronomy. Her home at Coombe Abbey
suggested to Dr. Johnson “The Happy Valley of Rasselas.”
She was devoted to her brother Henry, and inconsolable at
his death, in 1612. In the following year she married the
Count Palatine, and great festivities took place in London.
The poets Donne and Daniel call her “the pearl of
Britain,” and Sir Henry Wotton wrote verses in her
praise:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Tell me, if she were not designed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Th’ Eclipse and glory of her kind.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span></p>
<p>Her chief fault was extravagance, which increased her
pecuniary troubles with her unfortunate husband. But they
were happy together and had many children, one of whom
was that Elizabeth who became the pupil and friend of the
philosophic Descartes.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>Anne Clifford, born 1589, daughter and heir of the Earl
of Cumberland, had been forbidden by her father to learn
Latin, much to her chagrin. She made up for it by studying
all that she could find to read in English, and by that
time through translations she found a good deal. Her
diary still remains at the British Museum. She gives a
beautiful description of her mother’s character, and of her
moral virtues, prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance.
She was not a linguist, but a reader, a thinker, and a
<i>chemist</i>, and possessed “many excellent knowledges, human
and divine.”</p>

<p>Her tutor was Samuel Daniel, “that religious and honest
poet who composed the Civil Wars of England in verse,”
and he led her to the study of history, old archives,
armorial bearings, and the laws regarding inheritance,
whereby she was able to sustain the noble fight against
her King and her husband concerning the right of heiresses
to transmit property undiverted to their heirs. What she
had received from her father she wished to leave to her
daughters. In this <i>she</i> succeeded, though the laws drifted
after her date to the exclusions and disabilities from which
modern women have so much suffered.</p>

<p>She was capable in land estate management and architecture,
in which Cromwell gave her practical lessons by
demolishing her castles for her fidelity to the King. Each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
time he destroyed them she rebuilt them stronger, until,
fired with admiration at her courage, he bade his officers
desist from further molestation.</p>

<p>Her funeral sermon, preached by Bishop Rainbow, was
an eloquent oration, in which he said that the life of this
great, good woman was fitter for a history than a sermon.
He alluded to her studies and her conversation with admiration.
“She could speak well on anything, from predestination
to slea-silk.”</p>

<p>Thus, I think the women of the sixteenth century proved
to their successors that they were fit, in the words of the
little Marie Stuart, to study anything, if so be they were
granted opportunity.</p>

<p>The lives of these illustrative individuals, who became
illustrious because they <i>excelled</i> many others, suggest the
probability of a much more general culture, and that of a
higher standard, than has been hitherto realized. It is to
be hoped that more research may yield more information,
and account for the tidal backdraw in the position of
women between these times and our own. Men grow
great, and poets become inspired in proportion to the influence
of the other sex, and it is only reasonable to add to
the causes of the special glory of the sixteenth century, the
greatness of its women.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Note to Article III</span><br><span class="small">ANOTHER DEBT OF JOHN SHAKESPEARE</span></h3>


<p>Since my article on “Shakespeare and Asbies” appeared
(“Athenæum,” 14th and 21st March) I have had two communications
about the Shakespeares. The later, from Mr. Young,
seems to suggest another mysterious debt of some John Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Henry Higford, gent., of Solihull, Warwickshire, in his own
person appeared on the fourth day against John Shakysper, formerly
of Stratford-upon-Avon in county Warwick, “whyttawer,”
and against John Musshen, formerly of Walton Dobell in said
county, on the plea that each of them should pay him £30
which they owed him; and against John Wheler, formerly of
Stratford-on-Avon in said county, yeoman, on the plea that he
should pay him 80<i>s.</i> which he owed him, and unjustly detained.
And if they did not come and pay, that the Sheriff should bring
their bodies here on Easter Day in five weeks (Common Pleas,
Roll 1313, membrane 399, Easter 15 Eliz., 1573).</p>

<p>Now this was a “whyttawer nuper de Stratford.” Could this
mean a leather-dresser for making <i>gloves</i>? Or could it mean a
leather-dresser for making shoes? Was it the John Shakespeare
who went to live in Clifford Chambers, and was confused with
<i>our John</i> by earlier writers? Or could he be the John Shakespeare
who ran his race in Stratford as “corvizer” from 1580 till 1592?</p>

<p>All these questions might be asked, as well as the more important
one: Is there any reason to believe that the language <i>at
that date</i> could fit John, William Shakespeare’s father? I should
be glad to know.</p>

<p class="right">
<i>“Athenæum,” 25th April 1914.</i><br>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span></p>

<p>PS. Some correspondence followed on as to the meaning of
“Whittawer,” and Mr. Arthur Betts sent me his pamphlet on the
white tawers, or tanners of white leather. They were held in
some discredit owing to their frequently receiving the skins of
poached game, and they were forbidden to dwell near a royal
forest. I had been puzzled by the use of “nuper” in the citation,
but I find it was used only in one of three descriptions,
to prevent evasion. I therefore think it must refer to our John
Shakespeare.</p>

SHAKESPEARE</span></h3>


<p>The application of the term “Adolescens” to “Gilbert
Shakespeare,” in the Burial Register of Stratford-on-Avon,
and the information it has been supposed to give concerning the
poet’s family, make an examination of the context incumbent upon
Shakespearean students. There are, indeed, some noteworthy
peculiarities concerning the Stratford use of terms, which I have
not seen in any other of the Registers which I have studied.</p>

<p>The Registers of Stratford are, however, like many others, a
mixture of English and Latin entries. Sometimes Latin prevails
for a page or two, and then English runs on for a like period,
sometimes the entries are almost time about in each language,
sometimes both languages are used in the same entry, as “Jane
uxor John Davis als Keliam, she was Kild with a tinker on the
Bridge, July 2ⁿᵈ 1599,” or “John filius William Walford Draper.”
The commonest Latin terms are of course <i>filius</i>, <i>filia</i>, <i>uxor</i>,
<i>Vidua</i>, <i>clericus</i>, <i>generosus</i>, but the writers were rarely careful with
their genitives. There were occasional notes of a man’s trade,
sometimes in Latin, much more frequently in English.</p>

<p>But there was one period during which Latin gained the upper
hand, and that was the period after Mr. Bifield had finished his
transcript of the early registers, and had given up signing its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
pages. The signature of “William Gilbard alias Higges minister”
was a new one to the Register in 1603, though he had been
known as assistant Schoolmaster and then as Curate, since 1563
at least. It is not clear whether there was a new Parish Clerk at
the time, or whether the Curate wrote the notices himself, or if
he gave any directions to aid the intelligence of the clerk. But
coincident with this change of signature, there is a great increase
in Latin phrases, many more qualifying adjectives are added,
and attention is generally paid to the Latin <i>cases</i>. “Almsman”
becomes “Elemosynarius,” or “Eliēmo;” “Bastard” becomes
“Nothus” or “Notha”; trades are translated into Latin, as
“Scissor,” “Lanio,” “Fab. lig.,” “Calcearius,” “Pistor.” Never
before had there been any reference to age, or to condition, other
than “Uxor,” “Vidua.” Now there is <i>one</i> case of “Margaret
Urlle, <i>Cælebs</i>, 8ᵗʰ April 1609” who does not seem to have been
born in the town. Early in the period which we may suppose
Sir William Gilbard alias Higges to have controlled the entries,
occurs the first use of “<i>adolescens</i>” in the Registers, and the
<i>only one</i>, excepting that of Gilbert Shakespeare. “Anna Yat,
adolescens, Jan. 8ᵗʰ 1602,” (Burials), On referring back, I find that
one Anne Yate, daughter of John Yate, was baptized on 20th
September 1573, and that another of the same name, daughter of
Richard Yate, was baptized on 29th September 1589. It might
be assumed that it was the younger of these two who was buried
at thirteen years of age, though why, among all the other young
girls buried there, she alone should be singled out to be described
as “adolescens,” baffles explanation. Her father was still alive,
and absence of any reference to him is also strange. If it were
applied to the elder Anne, who was twenty-nine years old, it
would be less surprising to find her father unnoticed, but “adolescens,”
in its ordinary sense, could hardly have been applied
to her. The only other contemporary of the name was a wife,
married as <i>Annys</i>, buried as <i>Anne</i> Yate.</p>

<p>But if there are only two entries of “adolescens,” the first
applied to a female, and the second to a male, there are many of
a resembling word, “adolocentulus,” which should mean a very
young man, but it is very difficult to guess what it really did
mean in Stratford Latin.</p>

<p>“Isabella Rodes, Adolocentula” was buried 12th May 1604.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
She does not seem to have been born in the parish. There is no
other mention of her name, so her age cannot be estimated, but
as an “Annys Rodes, widow” had been buried a fortnight before,
she might have been an orphan daughter. “Nicholas Lane, Adolocentulus,
buried 16ᵗʰ Nov. 1604.” There was one Nicholas Lane,
son of John Lane baptized in 1569, and another in 1584; the
elder would have been thirty-five, the younger twenty. John Lane
himself had been buried in 1600, so this entry would seem to fit
the younger man. But on the other hand, “Richard Clarke,
<i>adolocentulus</i>,” buried 10th June 1605, was the son of Henry
Clarke, and had been baptized 11th March 1572, so that he
would be in his thirty-third year. “Margaret Clarke, adolocentula,”
buried 2nd June 1611, had been baptized in 1581 and was thus
thirty years old. (She had an illegitimate son Thomas in 1605.)
“Henry Ainge adolocentulus,” 24th December 1605, had been
baptized on 5th February 1581 and was therefore twenty-four
years old.</p>

<p>“Jone Hadon, Adolocentula” does not seem to have been born
in the parish. “Ales Brage, Adolocentula,” 8th January 1610, had
been baptized in July 1576, and was therefore about thirty-four.
“Susanna Daniel, Adolocentula,” 17th November 1608, had been
baptized on 24th May 1593, and would be fifteen. Her father
had died in 1596, and she might be alone. The only other “adolocentula”
does not seem to have been baptized in the parish.</p>

<p>The result of studying “adolocentula,” therefore, is as unsatisfactory
as that of studying “adolescens.”</p>

<p>William Gilbard alias Higges signed the Register pages till July
1610, and he <i>may</i> have superintended them till May 1611, when
the page was signed once by John Rogers, Vicar. In that year the
curate, William Gilbert alias Higgs, died, and, strange to say,
was buried the <i>very day before Gilbert Shakespeare</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, on 2nd
February 1611-2.</p>

<p>Does this imply that the clerk was left to his own classic inspirations
or memories in writing the register, or that his superintendence
was taken over by the succeeding assistant minister,
Edward Woolmer? Under him the language of the text gradually
simplified, until it took on a new varnish of Latin under Mr.
Richard Watts.</p>

<p>But the fact remains, that “adolescens,” which had only <i>once</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
appeared before, <i>never</i> appears again, and it is difficult to gauge
the extent of its meaning and use. It has been held by all writers
to support Halliwell-Phillipps’ statement that the poet’s brother
went to settle as a haberdasher in St. Bride’s, London, and lived
to a great age. I have definitely proved that Halliwell-Phillips was
mistaken in saying that Gilbert was a London haberdasher (see my
article in the “Athenæum,” 29th December 1900, “John Shakespeare
of Ingon, and Gilbert of St. Brides”), p. 62. The whole
arguments of the family-wills tell against the notion of the survival
of the poet’s brother, and my careful study in registers helps to
convince me that the word “adolescens” is not here used in its
normal and natural sense.</p>

<p>That should be “a youth” or “junior.” In either case if this
is accepted as true of some unknown nephew of the poet, it would
imply that Gilbert Shakespeare married <i>somewhere</i>, baptized this
child <i>somewhere</i>, and died <i>somewhere</i>, and that the mother died
<i>somewhere</i>, none of these facts having yet been proved. If it had
its ordinary meaning, it would suggest that the father and mother
were already dead, and the “youth” stood alone in the world.
But if so, where was Gilbert buried? The name of Shakespeare
would have been sure to have been noticed, either in London or
in country registers.</p>

<p>The difficulties seem to me so great,<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> that the alternative seems
a trifling one in comparison, that the word, for some inexplicable
reason, has been unintelligently applied to the poet’s brother
Gilbert. In this opinion I have taken much counsel from students
of registers, and they agree that it is the most natural explanation
of the puzzle. And therefore I believe firmly that Gilbert Shakespeare,
the poet’s brother, died and was buried at the date recorded
in the register (Feb. 3, 1611-2), which accounts for his not being
mentioned in the poet’s will.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Note to Article XI</span> (1)<br><span class="small">WILLIAM COMBE AND THE PROPOSED WELCOMBE
ENCLOSURES, 1614-19</span></h3>
</div>

<p>The story of the attempted enclosures at Welcombe at the
beginning of the seventeenth century has always been considered
chiefly of interest because Shakespeare’s name was associated
with it. But the incidents are of great importance in the history
of Stratford-on-Avon and its relation to William Combe, entirely
apart from the interest Shakespeare gives to the proceedings, The
facts are worth recalling in relation to the great fires, which I discussed
in this paper lately under the title of “Fires and Thatch at
Stratford-on-Avon.” Just about the time of the disastrous fire of
9th July 1614, John Combe, the money-lender, died. After
various charitable bequests, in his will dated 28th January 1612-13,
he desires to be buried in the church near his mother, and a convenient
tomb to be set over him of the value of threescore pounds.
He leaves his brother George Combe the land “called Parson’s
Close, or Shakespeare’s Close” in Hampton; to his brother
John Combe his property in Warwick; residuary legatees were
William and Thomas Combe his nephews (proved 10th November
1616). Hardly had they inherited (before even they had
proved their uncle’s will), William took it into his head to enclose
the Common Fields of Welcombe, over most of which he was
chief landlord. We can find a good many details of the proceedings,
preserved in the crabbed characters in which Thomas
Greene made his memoranda, in a few leaves which have been
called “His Diary,” now among the Stratford Records. This
shows that Shakespeare went up to London on 16th November,
and next day Thomas Greene, then staying in London, “went to
see him how he did.” They were both full of “the enclosures,”
and Shakespeare told Greene the latest news of the plan and the
schemes, adding that “he thought nothing would be done.” That
very night, however, Greene drew up the petition of the town,
and “gave it to Edmund to write fair, so that Greene and Mr.
Wyatt might see it before it was wrytten to be presented to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
Lordes,” that is, the Lords of the Privy Council. On the 22nd
Greene records that he heard that Lord Carew meant to oppose
the enclosing all he might, and Mr. Mainwaring said if he did not
do it <i>well</i> he cared not to do it at all. This “Lord Carew” is he
who married Joyce Clopton, and whose tomb is in the church at
Stratford. Thomas Greene was Town Clerk, and he notes on
5th December that six of the company (himself among them)
were to “go to Mr. Combe, and present their loves, and desire he
would be pleased to forbeare the enclosing.” They went on the
9th, and were not satisfied with the results. William Combe said
he would be glad of their loves, but the enclosure would not be
hurtful to the town; indeed, there would be some profit in it.
Thomas Combe said “they were all curres,” and spoke of “spitting
one of the dogs.”</p>

<p>Mr. Spenser said the Lord Chancellor was their friend, and
Sir Fulke Greville advised them on a precedent. But William
Combe went on determinedly. “The Miscellaneous Documents”
and reports of the Council meetings at the Hall give details of
his actions. Thomas Greene says in his Diary on the 23rd December
1614, that at the Hall that day the company had written
through him to Mr. Mainwaring and Mr. Shakespeare (and he
himself wrote a private letter “to his cosen Shakespeare”) to
prove the “inconvenience” of the proposed enclosure. Neither
of the letters to Shakespeare has been preserved, but that to
Mainwaring has, and from it we may have some notion of the
arguments of the other. (Wheler MS., i, 109.) This Mr. Mainwaring
was the steward and agent of the Lord Chancellor Ellesmere,
who seems to have had some interest in local affairs, and
who in the earlier stages at least seems to have co-operated with
William Combe. It was addressed “To the Worshipfull Arthur
Mainwaring, Esq., at the Rt. Hon. the Lord Chancellor his howse.”
The Bailiff and the company showed him that by the Charter of
Edward VI the tithes were allowed them for the support of the
almshouses, the school, and the bridge. “We hear that some land
is conveyed to you in Welcombe, and that you intend enclosure.
We entreat you to call to mind the manifold great and often
miseries this Borough hath sustained by casualties of fires fresh
in memory, and now of late one dying in the ashes of desolacion,
and in your Christian meditations to bethink you that such inclosure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>
will tend to the great disabling of performance of those
good meanings of that godly king, to the ruyne of this Borough
wherein live above seven hundred poor which receive almes,
whose curses and clamours will be poured out to God against the
enterprise of such a thing.” That was the way the Corporation
looked at the enclosure. They “could not fulfil their trust to do
the best possible for the town” without opposing it tooth and nail.
And Thomas Greene could not fulfil his duty to the Corporation
without working along with them, and we may be sure that his
letter to Shakespeare was strong enough to convince the poet
also. The Christmas of 1614 was a gloomy one for Stratford, with
the ruins of blackened houses lying around, the poor calling for
shelter and food, and the great dread of this new disaster looming
all the more largely before them because of the general depression.
The year 1615 saw a pitched battle. The aldermen took
what legal action they could in their own right; they filed their
“complaints” in many courts; they were driven into unnecessary
expenses of various kinds; they sent Thomas Greene often to
Warwick and to London; and all because of William Combe’s
unsettling whim. He had sent his own servants and employed
others, Stephen Sly among them, to dig ditches round the land
he wished to enclose, and Thomas Greene writes that on 7th
January “William Combe had told Baylis that some of the better
sort meant to go and throw down the ditches, and said ‘I would
they durst’ in a threatening manner with very great passion and
anger.” Two days after some of the Corporation did, indeed,
send on their spades to avoid a riot, and they went themselves
and filled in the ditches. They were personally injured by Combe’s
servants. William Combe said, “They were a company of factious
knaves, and he will do them all the harm he can,” and added,
“they were puritan knaves, and underlings in their colour.”
Next day Mr. Archer was appealed to as a justice of the peace
and a commoner to prevent a breach of the peace. He proposed
for the preventing of tumults that there should be a stay of proceedings;
that no further ditching or ploughing should be done
till the 24th March, and no further ditches to be thrown down
before that date. (While they were discussing these matters, however,
the remainder of the ditches were being filled in by women
and children.) On the 11th of January 1614-15 they took an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
attorney’s opinion as to what constituted a riot; and on the 12th
Mr. Replingham came to the Hall, hoping to talk the company
over. The Bailiff said he would never agree to the enclosures as
long as he lived. Then Mr. Replingham wanted him to bind
some of the inhabitants over to good behaviour. Thomas Greene
said he would not bind them for all his clerk’s fees. On the 16th
Mr. Combe went to London to push his cause as he might. He
then rated the value of the enclosure at £250 per annum. On
the 25th of January Mr. Chandler and Mr. Daniel Baker went to
London to take advice on their side. A lull seemed to come into
the proceedings, probably because of Mr. Archer’s decision above
noted. On the 24th of February they resolved to take Sir Edward
Coke’s opinion. On the 22nd of March Mr. Chandler for the Corporation
did present a petition to the Lord Chief Justice at
Coventry, and Mr. Combe called him a knave and a liar to his
face. The Lord Chief Justice bade Chandler remind him of the
case when he came to Warwick on the 27th. There he definitely
said that it was against the laws of the realm and must be stopped.
Thomas Greene says in his Diary, 1st April 1615: “Mr. Baker
told me at his shop-house that the day before he was in Sir
William Somerville’s and Mr. Combe’s company a-hunting in
Awston fields, and Mr. Combe told him he might thank me for
the petition, and offered to sell him lands to the amount of £50
per annum lying in Bridgetown among the Lord Carew’s land
there, and that he never meant to inclose.” On the 2nd of April
Mr. Combe asked Mr. Alderman Parsons why he was against the
enclosures, and he said, “We are all sworn men for the good of
the Borough and to preserve their inheritance, therefore they
would not have it said in future time they were the men which
gave way to the undoing of the town; and that all three fires were
not so great a loss to the town as the enclosures would be.” On
the 12th of April Mr. Parsons reported that he had been beaten by
Mr. Combe’s men.</p>

<p>On the 19th April Laurence Wheeler and Lewis Hiccox started
ploughing on their own land within the intended enclosure, and
Mr. Combe railed at them; but the next day they returned, and
Mr. Nash and many other tenants did the same, and Mr. Combe
became still more wrathful. Mr. Combe’s next move was to try
to get Sir Edward Greville and Sir Arthur Ingram to sell him the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
royalty of the town; but Sir Henry Rainsford told Greene he
would never get that, and added that he was going to sue Mr.
Combe on his own account in an action for trespass, and would
sue him in the Star Chamber for riots, and he was going to sue
Thomas Combe on a bond for £40, and so the bitterness spread.
September saw fresh quarrels with Mr. Combe. On 14th December
Greene notes, “Mr. Francis Smith told me that Mr. Thomas
Combe told him that his brother would plow this year for his own
good, but next year would lay it down to spite me. The Combes
questioned my Lord Chief Justice’s authority to make any such
order as was made, there being nothing before him.” And again
there was another Christmas clouded by threatened enclosures,
Shakespeare’s last Christmas upon earth.</p>

<p>On 21st February 1615-16, the Corporation agreed that the
enclosure should be “made a Town Cause,” and the charges
defrayed out of the revenue, for the battle was becoming fiercer
than ever. Their opponent, Mr. William Combe, had been made
High Sheriff of the county, the very officer delegated by the
Crown to <i>prevent</i> riots, etc., which he was really rousing. Mr.
Baker on the 24th told him and his brother “at the Bridge end
towards the woodyard that he marvelled they would, contrary to
my Lord’s order, enclose and dig in the Common. They said they
hoped my Lord would not hinder them from doing what they
would with their own, and Mr. William Combe said the ditch was
made to save his corn.” The Combes retorted on Mr. Baker that
“the Corporation had given money to my lord’s gentleman to
work my lord, <i>i.e.</i>, Sir Edward Coke, and that was no good employment
for the Town revenue!” In Mr. Sheriff’s absence
Mr. Thomas Combe set some workmen to work, and when the
Sheriff came home he approved of it, and promised the workmen
they should come to no harm. On the 1st of March some members
of the Council went to inspect and found workmen “finishing
twenty-seven ridges of the enclosure, acre’s length a-piece.” “Mr.
Sheriff told Morrell that if he were not out of authority he would send
him to gaol, and having divers times impounded his sheep, bade
him tell my Lord Coke that for every several trespass he would
have a several action, and for every sixpence damage he would
recover against him six pounds.”</p>

<p>On the 2nd of March 1615-16, Mr. Chandler having sent his man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
Michael Ward to the place where Combe’s men were digging to
fling down the ditches, they assaulted him, and would not let him
proceed, and Stephen Sly said that “if the best in Stratford were
to go there to throw the ditch down he would bury his head at
the bottom.”</p>

<p>No wonder that in the petition of the 27th of March 1616, the
Corporation stated, “Mr. Combe being of such an unbridled disposition
he should be restrained.” In that Lent term at the Assize
Court my Lord Coke delivered his final decision, and told Combe
to set his mind at rest, for he would “neither enclose nor lay down
any arable land, nor plough up any ancient greensward.” The
Corporation told Mr. Combe that they desired his goodwill, but
they would ever withstand the enclosure: and on the 10th of
April Mr. High Sheriff told Mr. John Greene that he was out of
hope now ever to enclose.</p>

<p>So Shakespeare sank to rest that month with the belief that the
struggle was over, and there would be no enclosure in Welcombe.
But it was not over yet by a long way. Mr. William Combe made
up his mind to defy the Lord Chief Justice as well as the Corporation.
He moved gently now, however. On the 24th of June 1616,
he wrote to the Corporation from Abchurch, desiring their loves,
and showing how he would remedy all their objections, a long
letter still among the records. They replied that they were desirous
of his love and of peace, but they prayed him against the
enclosure, and said they would by all lawful means hinder it. The
miscellaneous documents of Stratford-on-Avon show that the
Bailiff and Burgesses of Stratford also complained to the Court of
Common Pleas against William Combe for enclosing. Their notes
show “The points to be complayned of and contayned in our
petition are that Mr. Combe hath not laid down meres according
to my Lord Hobart’s order, and the certificates of the justices
upon the reference. And that he hath decayed 117 ridges of tilling
and neglecting the farming thereof contrary to the order and
contrary to his own word and promise made to the judges and
justices at the tyme of their conference. My Lord Coke at Lent
Assizes 13 James I, and my Lord Hobart confirmed this assize.
The grief for decaying is the destruction of our common, and the
decaying of the tilling is the losse of our tythes with which our
poor are free.” They also presented “My Lord Coke and my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>
Lord Hubbard their orders for the restraint of enclosier and decay
of tillage in the feeldes of Stratford, 1617.”</p>

<p>But the struggle continued during 1618, though more warily on
Combe’s side. The Privy Council had become interested. It had
dawned on them that they had had to excuse the subsidies from
Stratford more than once on account of the fires, and if it happened,
as a petition from the Corporation suggested, they might
have to excuse them again on account of Combe’s enclosure. On
the 14th of February 1618 the Privy Council referred the consideration
of the Stratford petition to the Master of the Rolls and Sir
Edward Coke, and wrote officially to William Combe in a very
sharp way. He was to restore the enclosures to their pristine condition,
and whatever the judges decided to do with him in regard
to the course he had taken in defiance of the order of the justices
in assize and the certificate of Sir Richard Verney he must not
fail to obey, or he would answer it at his peril.</p>

<p>Apparently Combe was at last alarmed, and gave in, not too
soon, for decisions had gone against him in every court, and
orders were out against him for “contempt of court” also. Influence
saved him from some of the consequences. In the Stratford
Miscellaneous Documents there is one called “Dispensation
to William Combe for enclosing,” or “Mr. Combe, his pardon for
enclosing.” But he had to pay a fine of £4 for that, and to go to
all the expense of putting the land back as the people were used
to see it. By the summer of 1619 Stratford-on-Avon and its Corporation
were at rest as to Combe’s enclosure.</p>

<p>I have found that the final award for the Stratford enclosures,
under the Act of Parliament for enclosures, 15 George III, was
signed 21st January 1775. They amounted to 1,635 acres, 1 rood,
18 perches.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Note to Article XI</span> (2)<br><span class="small">FIRES AND THATCH IN STRATFORD</span></h3>
</div>

<p>The distressing fires which so frequently raged in Stratford-on-Avon
during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries may
be considered among the causes likely to account somewhat for
the fact that no letters of Shakespeare’s have come down to us.
These fires (1594-6, 1598, 1614) were almost of national importance,
as they were serious enough to force the Corporation to
petition the Queen for the remission of taxes—which was granted
(Wheeler MS. i. 46); and sometimes also they had permission
to collect for their poor in the neighbouring towns and counties.
A touching letter in 1598 from Richard Quiney as “the poor
suitor from Stratford,” whose purse is weakened by long sojourning
in London “shews that the Collector was retaining £24 10<i>s.</i>,
while the poor needed it,” is in Wheler MS., i, 54.</p>

<p>In the petition of 1598 they state that the town had lost
£12,000 by two very grievous fires, on which petition the Queen
was graciously pleased to instruct the Attorney-General to give a
book of discharge for the subsidy, 17th December 1598. They
again petitioned to be relieved of their duties to the Queen and to
the poor in 1601 (7th June). Again a dreadful fire took place in
1614, at the time of the death of John Combe, when eighty-five
houses were burned down, besides many smaller edifices, and
again petitions went up to the Queen for the remission of taxes,
as they had 700 poor on their hands. Their distress and anxiety
were intensified just at that time by William Combe’s determined
efforts to start enclosures at Welcombe. They naturally saw in
this a reduction of tithes, from which were endowed their school
and almshouses, and in their many petitions against his high-handed
action they always referred to their town as “being greatly
ruinated by fire.” At last it seems to have struck some of the
members of the Privy Council that they should inquire why
Stratford should have more than its share of fires. Some one in
Stratford found the cause in the thatched roofs of the period, and
the Corporation forbade any more houses to be built with thatched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>
roofs; indeed, ordered the thatch of old houses to be exchanged for
the greater safety of tiles and slates. This would materially change
the appearance of Stratford, not improving it in an artistic sense,
but making it much safer. Now, there are papers in London
which often fill out the information preserved among the valuable
records of Stratford-on-Avon. I have come across some letters in
the unpublished Register of the Privy Council, which may be
added to the history of the town. They show that some one, or
some party of inhabitants, had complained to the Privy Council
against three men, who persisted in using thatch, and they tell
their own story, so I give them in full.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>16th March, 1618-19. To the Bayliffe, Chief Aldermen, and
Towne Clarcke for the tyme being of Stratford-upon-Avon.</p>

<p>Wee sende you heere enclosed a petition exhibited unto us
on the behalf of that Burrough of Stratford-upon-Haven, wherein
is humbly represented unto us the greate and lamentable losse
happened to that towne by casualty of Fyer, which of late years
hath been very frequently occasioned by means of thatched
cottages, stacks of straw, furze, and such-like combustible stuffe,
which are suffered to be erected, and made confusedly in most of
the principal parts of the town without restraint: and which being
still continewed cannot but prove very dangerous and subject to
the like inconveniences. And, therefore, wee have thought meete
for the better safety and securing that towne from future dainger,
hereby to authorize and require you to take order that from henceforward
there be not any house or cottage that shall be erected by
any owner of land or other, suffered to be thatched, nor any
stacks or pyles of strawe or furzes made in any part of that towne,
either upon the streetes or elsewhere, that may in any way endanger
the same by fyer as formerly, but that all the houses and
cottages to be hereafter built within the towne be covered with
tyles or slates, and the foresayd stacks and pyles removed to fitt
and convenient places without the towne. And for the houses and
cottages already built and covered with strawe there, wee do likewise
require you to cause the same to be altered and reformed
according to theis directions with as much expedition as may
stand with convenience, and as the safety and wellfare of that
towne may any way require. Herein wee require you to take order
accordingly, and in case of any opposition to theis our directions,
whereby the performance of the same may be interrupted or
stayed to make certificate unto us of the names of such as shall
not conforme themselves accordingly that such further order may
be taken therein as shall be expedient.</p>

<p>10th November, 1619. A warrant to John Foster, one of the
messingers of his Majesties’ Chamber, to bring before their lordships,
George Badger, William Shawe, and John Beesley alias
Coxey, inhabitants in the Burrow of Stratford-upon-Avon, in the
county of Warwick.</p>

<p>26th November, 1619. A letter to [no name added]. You
shall understand that complaint was made unto us by a petitioner
in the name of the Baliffe and Burgesses of the Town of Stratford-upon-Haven
that whereas there was an order lately made at this
Board restrayning the use of thatching of houses and cottages in
the towne to prevent and avoyd the danger and great losse by fier
that of late tyme hath often happened there by means of such
thatched houses to the utter ruyne and overthrow of many of the
inhabitants: Theis three parties, George Badger, William Shaw,
and John Beesley, refusing to conforme themselves to our said
order, had in contempt thereof erected certain thatched houses
and cottages to the ill example of others, and the endangering of
the towne by the like casualty of fire. Whereuppon they being
convented before us, forasmuch as they do absolutely deny that
they have shewed any such disobedience at all to our said order
nor committed any manner of act contrary thereunto since the
publication of the same in that towne. And that the partie that
exhibited the complaint against them in the name of the towne
did not appear to make good his informacion, wee have thought
good to dismiss the said Badger, Shaw, and Beesley for the

<h3><span class="smcap">Note to Article XIII</span><br><span class="small">SHAKSPEARE’S BUST AT STRATFORD<br>ITS RESTORATION IN 1749</span></h3>
</div>

<p>I had been searching for years for contemporary notices of the
alteration, in every possible direction, but I only discovered
what I wanted a few months ago, viz., the letters of those concerned
in the restoration.</p>

<p>The figures are not so large, nor the details quite so full, as I
had hoped they would be; but, such as they are, they ought to be
laid before the public. They are taken from the Wheler Collection,
Stratford-on-Avon, a number of copies from the MSS. of the
Rev. Joseph Greene, Master of the Grammar School. The series
begins with the account of the reasons for the movement towards
restoration:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As the generous proposals of the proprietors of the two greatest
playhouses in this Kingdom were kindly accepted and encouraged,
in relation to each of them acting a play for the sole purpose of
erecting a new monument to the memory of Shakespeare in Westminster
Abbey, and as the curious original monument and bust of
that incomparable poet, erected above the tomb that enshrines
his dust in the Church of Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, is
through length of years and other accidents become much impaired
and decayed, an offer has been kindly made by the judicious
and much esteemed Mr. John Ward and his company to act one
of Shakespeare’s plays, vizt., “Othello; or, The Moor of Venice”
(in the Town Hall) at Stratford, on Tuesday, the ninth of this
instant, September, 1746, the receipts arising from which representation
are to be solely appropriated to the repairing of the
original monument aforesaid.</p>
</div>

<p>Then follows a “copy of an old play-bill at the time of repairing
and beautifying Shakespeare’s monument, with the Rev.
Joseph Greene’s remarks on the performers. The printed bill was
drawn up by Greene himself, and somewhat corrected by Mr.
John Ward, grandfather of the present celebrated Mrs. Siddons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>
(MSS. penes Mr. George).” The annotations by Greene give
some suggestions of the quality of the players.</p>

agreeable than Mrs. Wilson’s, but Mrs. Wilson has most judgment
in music</i>).</p>

<p>It is therefore humbly wished that such persons as have a
taste for the inimitable thoughts, the sublime expressions, the
natural and lively descriptions and characters of that great genius,
and consequently a value for his memory, will encourage the proposed
method of perpetuating it by attending the play at that
juncture for the laudable purpose of rebeautifying his venerable
monument and effigies.</p>

<p>N.B.—The money received on this occasion is to be deposited
in the hands of the churchwardens.
</p>
</div>

<p>In these days of Shakespeare Memorial Schemes, Shakespeare
Societies, and Shakespeare Exhibitions, it is well to remember the
simple aims and methods of eighteenth-century Memorial Committees
in their early proceedings, and take warning from the
results of delay, the causes for which are not clearly explained.
It was not the fault of the players that there was even so much
delay as there was.</p>

<p>By the following copies from Greene’s MSS. it appears “that
some disputes arose between the cashier-churchwardens for 1746,
and the contributors towards repairing Shakespeare’s Monument,
which reparation did not take place till 1748. Meetings took place,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
and forms were proposed for the churchwardens’ signatures to
compel the cashier to pay the money to the artist when he had
completed his undertaking.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Copy of a notice published on Sunday, November 20, 1748,
in Stratford Parish Church by the clerk, <i>me ibid concionant</i>.
MSS. Greene:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am desired to give notice that on Friday, 25th Nov. next,
there will be a meeting at the Market Hall in Stratford of those
persons who contributed for the repairing of Shakspeare’s monument,
in order to resolve upon a proper method of repairing and
beautifying the monument aforesaid.”</p>
</div>

<p>It seems that few or none attended, and that nothing was then
done. There was, however, a form drawn up which was meant to
be signed by those present:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We whose names are hereunder written or annexed, contributors
to the sum raised at the Town Hall of Stratford-upon-Avon,
for repairing and beautifying the original monument of
Shakspeare the poet, agree that the direction and execution of
that work shall be committed to Mr. John Hall, Limner; and
(provided he takes care, according to his ability, that the monument
shall become as like as possible to what it was, when first
erected) that then the money already raised for the purpose aforesaid
shall be forthwith paid him upon finishing the work. We will
also use our endeavours that such further money shall be collected
and given him as, with the former collections, may make up the
whole sum of sixteen pounds.</p>
</div>

<p>This was not then and there signed, but apparently was brought
forward again at a meeting held at the Falcon Inn, at which were
“present Sir Hugh Clopton, Rev. Mr. Kenwrick, Rev. Mr. Preston,
ye Master of the Free School (Greene), Mr. Alderman Haynes,
Mr. Joseph Broom, Mr. John Hall. A form proposed by Mr.
Greene to the gentlemen at the Falcon, but rejected by Mr.
Kenwrick (the vicar), who thought it did not sufficiently limit
what was to be done by Mr. Hall, as a form which he himself had
drawn up. November 30, 1748.” The differences were trifling.
“Agreed: That Mr. John Hall, Limner, shall repair and beautify,
or have the direction of repairing and beautifying, the original
monument of Shakespeare the poet, etc.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Joseph Greene, who seems to have had the work of restoration
very much at heart, had before the meetings at the Falcon
written a letter to Mr. John Ward, who was then at Hereford:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I believe you are by this time no stranger to the disputes
arisen on this side the country concerning the disposal of the
money collected at your representation of ‘Othello’ and generously
given by you for the repairing of Shakespeare’s original monument.
That it should lye as useless in our churchwardens’ hands, as cash
in the trunk of a miser, is making it not current, but dormant coin,
an impropriety which many of us can by no means approve of:
wherefore to set aside all idle surmises which any may chance to
entertain of knavishly mismanaging, or foolishly not managing,
the devoted sum, some gentlemen in our neighbourhood have
requested by me that you would speedily by letter, or some way
which you think most proper, signify to the parties concerned
what your intentions are, or what directions you would choose to
give concerning the money, that it may once more make its public
appearance in open daylight, and that a blacksmith’s sable apron
may no longer be used as a napkin wherein to hide your talents.</p>

<p>Be pleased, Sir, to inform us whether you would have the
affair postponed untill next summer, when (as we are assured)
you intend to revisit us, or whether you would chuse to have the
business forthwith proceeded upon, and some ingenious artificer
or other to be employed directly for the purpose. If the case, as
stated in this latter respect, is agreeable to you, whether, if any
particular ingenious person should be pitched upon and approved
by the majority of, or most considerable among, those who contributed
that night, whether in such case you would chuse to
acquiesce. Your setting us clear in these matters is much desired
by many persons, well-wishers to the memory of Shakespeare and
to the person of Mr. Ward, his and our ingenious benefactor.
Particularly be pleased to believe these the wishes of, Sir, your
very humble servant, Joseph Green, Stratford-upon-Avon. Nov. 23,
1748.</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Ward replied to this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sir,—I received the favor of yours, and am sensible of the
honor you and the gentlemen do me in appealing to my judgment
with regard to the monument of Shakespeare. I am ignorant of
any disputes that may have happened on that account, but own I
was surprised when I heard that nothing had been done in that
affair. I entirely submit to the opinions of the gentlemen who so
generously contributed to the play in every respect, and, as I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>
intend paying a visit to Stratford next summer, I hope to have
the pleasure of seeing the monument of our immortal Bard compleatly
finished; and will readily come into any proposal to make
good the sum for the use intended, if what is already in the
churchwardens’ hands should prove deficient.—I am, Sir, your
most obedient servant, John Ward. Hereford, Dec. 3, 1748.</p>
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Second Meeting at the Falcon.</span></h4>

<p>On Saturday evening, about nine o’clock, Mr. Kenwrick
having exhibited at Lilly’s at the Falcon a paper signifying what
Mr. Hall was to do, and of what materials to repair the monument
of Shakespeare, he proposed that Mr. Hall and Mr. Spur should
sign the agreement, the former that he might be obliged to do the
work in a compleat manner, and the latter that upon its being
finished he should pay to Mr. Hall the sum of twelve pounds
ten shillings; but though Mr. Hall seemed ready to sign this, and
a pen and ink were called for publicly, yet John Spur absolutely
refused, and said he would never sign any paper for the delivery
of the money, ridiculously vaunting it that his word ought to be
taken as credibly as his bond, and his word would go for £1,000.
However, at last he was prevailed upon to declare before the
undermentioned witnesses that as soon as the monument was
finished he would, without further delay, pay the money. This
affair happened December 10, 1748.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Witnesses—The Rev. Mr. Kenwrick, Vicar of Stratford; Joseph
Greene, clerk, Master of the Free School; Mr. Turbitt, mercer;
John Spur, blacksmith, cashier, churchwardens of the borough
when the money was collected in 1746; Mr. Benjamin Haynes,
glover; Mr. Joseph Broom, weaver (for the borough); Mr.
Samuel Morris, farmer; Mr. John Southam, of Welcombe,
farmer (for the parish churchwardens in 1748); Mr. John
Hall, undertaker of the work.</p>
</div>

<p>Another set of letters were “transcribed from the Greene MSS.
penes Mr. Wright, Lichfield.” The first from Mr. George Steevens,
editor of the Quarto edition of Shakespeare, dated Hampstead,
25th June 1770, to the Honourable James West, Esq., formerly
President of the Royal Society, then residing at Alscot, near
Stratford-on-Avon. He enclosed a letter from Mr. Theophilus
Lane, of Paston Court, near Hereford, addressed to himself, and
asked Mr. West to inform him whether the fact relative to Shakespeare’s
monument may be depended on, “as it should be added<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
to the other little anecdotes already known concerning him, if it
can be well ascertained.” He also asked a confirmation of some
conversations he had once had with his honourable friend some
years previously.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>The letter Steevens enclosed from Mr. Theophilus Lane itself
encloses another from a friend of his who had missed seeing him
on the day they both visited Shakespeare’s tomb. This friend had
misread the date of Mrs. Hall’s tombstone, and could not harmonize
it with the date on Shakespeare’s. He considered that Shakespeare’s
monument had little authority as to its date and inscription, and
thought that the monument must have been put up after everybody
had died who knew him.</p>

<p>This letter Theophilus Lane had forwarded to Steevens, and
Steevens to the Honourable James West. He apparently in his
turn had submitted it to the Rev. Joseph Greene, as the latter
writes to Mr. West a long letter containing his strictures on it.
He shows that the confusion of dates arose from misreading the
date of Mrs. Hall’s death as 1640 instead of 1649, which can be
corrected from the parish registers, and therefore that the other
arguments based upon this mistake are, of course, valueless; and
adds:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Applause is due to every investigator of <i>Truth</i>, provided he
is sufficiently attentive in his enquiries; and although I allow this
letterwriter’s superstructural remarks are ingenious enough, yet as
he did not sufficiently examine the solidity of his foundation, I
cannot think him entitled to any man’s thanks.</p>
</div>

<p>This letter is only of importance as illustrating a great deal of
the shallow criticism of Shakespeare, which is based upon preliminary
errors made by the critics themselves. In this case, we
might have hoped that the Rev. Joseph Greene would have explained
about the restoration of the tomb, so lately carried out
under his supervision, and settled the degree of fidelity with which
Mr. John Hall had carried out his instructions. Unfortunately,
the unnamed writer having only attempted to criticise the <i>dates</i>,
which were quite able to be checked, the Rev. Joseph Greene did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span>
not think fit to account for the extraordinary freshness of the tomb
so lately “beautified,” a freshness which was very likely to have
first roused the doubt as to “its authority” in the writer’s mind,
if he had not known all the circumstances.</p>

<p>This is all my new information, but it is something to go on. I
have not italicized the important words in my transcripts, but I
may now remind my readers that by 1746 the “curious original”
was much “impaired and decayed,” a decay so serious as to
rouse the actively sympathetic feelings of Mr. John Ward towards
necessary restoration. The fact is recorded that Mr. John Hall
was to have the doing of the work of “repairing and rebeautifying,”
or “the direction” of it. But that “materials” were to be
used.</p>

<p>My arguments are these. No one would call the present tomb
a “curious” one; but, as represented by Dugdale in his “Antiquities
of Warwick” (1651), it is “curious,” a curiousness which
had increased, by the process of decay, when Rowe produced it
in his “Life,” 1709. Mr. John Hall, acting in all good faith, after
provincial notions of restoration in the eighteenth century, would
fill up the gaps, restore what was missing, as he thought it ought
to be, and finally repaint it according to the original colours,
traces of which he might still be able to see in the hollows of the
bust.</p>

<p>It would only be giving good value for his money to his churchwardens
if he added a cloak, a pen, and manuscript. He could
not help changing the expression, from the worn and thoughtful
face preserved by Dugdale, to the plumped-out foundation he
made in some “material” convenient for his re-beautifying colours.
I have stated elsewhere that I consider the so-called “portrait”
at the birth-place to have been painted either by Hall or from
Hall, and the little, old representation of Shakespeare’s tomb lent
by the Earl of Warwick for the present Shakespeare Exhibition at
Whitechapel Art Gallery probably dates from the same period.</p>

<p>I myself consider Dugdale and his draughtsmen wonderfully
careful for their period. Those tombs which have not been altered
are remarkably faithful representations. See, for instance, the
tomb of Sir Thomas Lucy at Charlecote. Now, Dugdale was a
Warwickshire man, born only a comparatively short distance from
Stratford, eleven years before Shakespeare died. He was an admirer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>
of Shakespeare, and knew the bust he engraved. He was in Stratford
in attendance on Queen Henrietta Maria when, at the outbreak
of the Civil War, she stayed in Shakespeare’s house as the
guest of his daughter, Mrs. Hall. There was every reason to believe
that he would be more careful in regard to representing Shakespeare’s
tomb (instead of less careful) than he was with others.</p>

<p>The second edition of Dugdale’s “Warwickshire” was revised,
corrected, expanded, the illustrations <i>checked</i>, and added to by
Dr. Thomas, who was also a Warwickshire man, residing very near
Stratford-on-Avon. And he produced the representation of the
original tomb from the same unaltered block which Dugdale used.
There is, therefore, little reason to doubt that Dugdale was fairly
correct both in the face and figure of the “curious monument,”
and that the alterations made in 1748-9, great as they are, did not
strike the gentlemen of Stratford-on-Avon as anything <i>worse</i> than
“beautifying.” The dates and verses were left as they were, and
the monument, thus strengthened, survives to preserve the memory
of the “Sweet Swan of Avon!”</p>

<p>All this has no bearing on the Baconian controversy. It only
relates to the likeness of the presentment and the reliability of
Dugdale.</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
